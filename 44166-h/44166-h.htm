<h2 class="b2"><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</a></h2>

<p>An attempt has been made in the following pages to portray
Abraham Lincoln, mainly in his relations to the country at large
during his eventful administration.</p>

<p>With this view, it has not been deemed necessary to cumber the
work with the minute details of his life prior to that time. This
period has, therefore, been but glanced at, with a care to present
enough to make a connected whole. His Congressional career
and his campaign with Senator Douglas are presented in outline,
yet so, it is believed, that a clear idea of these incidents in his life
can be obtained.</p>

<p>After the time of his election as President, however, a different
course of treatment has been pursued. Thenceforward, to the close
of his life, especial pains have been taken to present everything
which should show him as he was&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;the Statesman persistent, resolute,
free from boasting or ostentation, destitute of hate, never
exultant, guarded in his prophecies, threatening none at home or
abroad, indulging in no utopian dreams of a blissful future, moving
quietly, calmly, conscientiously, irresistibly on to the end he saw
with clearest vision.</p>

<p>Yet, even in what is presented as a complete record of his administration,
too much must not be expected. It is impossible, for
example, to thoroughly dissect the events of the great Rebellion in
a work like the present. Nothing of the kind has been attempted.
The prominent features only have been sketched; and that solely
for the purpose of bringing into the distinct foreground him whose
life is under consideration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
Various Speeches, Proclamations, and Letters, not vitally
essential to the unity of the main body of the work, yet valuable
as affording illustrations of the man&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;have been collected in the
Appendix.</p>

<p>Imperfect as this portraiture must necessarily be, there is one
conciliatory thought. The subject needs no embellishment. It
furnishes its own setting. The acts of the man speak for themselves.
Only such an arrangement is needed as shall show the
bearing of each upon the other, the development of each, the processes
of growth.</p>

<p>Those words of the lamented dead which nestle in our hearts so
tenderly&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;they call for no explanation. Potent, searching, taking
hold of our consciences, they will remain with us while reason lasts.</p>

<p>Nor will the people&#8217;s interest be but for the moment. The baptism
of blood to which the Nation has been called, cannot be forgotten
for generations. And while memories of him abide, there
will inevitably be associated with them the placid, quiet face, not
devoid of mirth&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;its patient, anxious, yet withal hopeful expression&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;the
sure, elastic step&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;the clearly cut, sharply defined speech
of him, who, under Providence, was to lead us through the trial
and anguish of those bitter days to the rest and refreshing of a
peace, whose dawn only, alas! he was to see.</p>

<p>Though this work may not rise to the height required, it is
hoped that it is not utterly unworthy of the subject. Such as it is&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;a
labor of love&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;it is offered to those who loved and labored with
the patriot and hero, with the earnest desire that it may not be
regarded an unwarrantable intrusion upon ground on which any
might hesitate to venture.</p>

<p>The leading incidents in the early life of the men who have
most decidedly influenced the destinies of our republic, present
a striking similarity. The details, indeed, differ; but the
story, in outline, is the same&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;&#8220;the short and simple annals
of the poor.&#8221;</p>

<p>Of obscure parentage&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;accustomed to toil from their tender
years&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;with few facilities for the education of the school&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;the
most struggled on, independent, self-reliant, till by their
own right hands they had hewed their way to the positions
for which their individual talents and peculiarities stamped
them as best fitted. Children of nature, rather than of art,
they have ever in their later years&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;amid scenes and associations
entirely dissimilar to those with which in youth and
early manhood, they were familiar&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;retained somewhat indicative
of their origin and training. In speech or in action&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;often
in both&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;they have smacked of their native soil. If
they have lacked the grace of the courtier, ample compensation
has been afforded in the honesty of the man. If their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
address was at times abrupt, it was at least frank and unmistakable.
Both friend and foe knew exactly where to find
them. Unskilled in the doublings of the mere politician or
the trimmer, they have borne themselves straight forward to
the points whither their judgment and conscience directed.
Such men may have been deemed fit subjects for the jests
and sneers of more cultivated Europeans, but they are none
the less dear to us as Americans&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;will none the less take their
place among those whose names the good, throughout the
world, will not willingly let die.</p>

<p>Of this class, pre-eminently, was the statesman whose life
and public services the following pages are to exhibit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abraham Lincoln</span>, Sixteenth President of the United
States, son of Thomas and Nancy Lincoln&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;the former a
Kentuckian, the latter a Virginian&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;was born February 12th,
1809, near Hodgenville, the county-seat of what is now known
as La Rue county, Kentucky. He had one sister, two years
his senior, who died, married, in early womanhood; and his
only brother, his junior by two years, died in childhood.</p>

<p>When nine years of age, he lost his mother, the family
having, two years previously, removed to what was then the
territory of Indiana, and settled in the southern part, near
the Ohio river, about midway between Louisville and Evansville.
The thirteen years which the lad spent here inured
him to all the exposures and hardships of frontier life. An
active assistant in farm duties, he neglected no opportunity
of strengthening his mind, reading with avidity such instructive
works as he could procure&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;on winter evenings, oftentimes,
by the light of the blazing fire-place. As satisfaction
for damage accidentally done to a borrowed copy of Weems&#8217;
Life of Washington&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;the only one known to be in the neighborhood&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;he
pulled fodder for two days for the owner.</p>

<p>At twenty years of age, he had reached the height of
nearly six feet and four inches, with a comparatively slender
yet uncommonly strong muscular frame&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;a youthful giant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
among a race of giants. Morally, he was proverbially honest,
conscientious, and upright.</p>

<p>In 1830, his father again emigrated, halting for a year on
the north fork of the Sangamon river, Illinois, but afterwards
pushing on to Coles county, some seventy miles to the eastward,
on the upper waters of the Kaskaskia and Embarrass,
where his adventurous life ended in 1851, he being in his
seventy-third year. The first year in Illinois the son spent
with the father; the next he aided in constructing a flat-boat,
on which, with other hands, a successful trip to New Orleans
and back was made. This city&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;then the El Dorado of the
Western frontiersman&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;had been visited by the young man,
in the same capacity, when he was nineteen years of age.</p>

<p>Returning from this expedition, he acted for a year as
clerk for his former employer, who was engaged in a store
and flouring mill at New Salem, twenty miles below Springfield.
While thus occupied, tidings reached him of an Indian
invasion on the western border of the State&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;since known as
the Black Hawk war, from an old Sac chief of that name,
who was the prominent mover in the matter. In New Salem
and vicinity, a company of volunteers was promptly raised,
of which young Lincoln was elected captain&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;his first promotion.
The company, however, having disbanded, he again
enlisted as a private, and during the three months&#8217; service of
this, his first short military campaign, he faithfully discharged
his duty to his country, persevering amid peculiar hardships
and against the influences of older men around him.</p>

<p>With characteristic humor and sarcasm, while commenting,
in a Congressional speech during the canvass of 1848, upon
the efforts of General Cass&#8217;s biographers to exalt their idol
into a military hero, he thus alluded to this episode in his
life:</p>

<p>&#8220;By the way, Mr. Speaker, did you know I am a military
hero? Yes, sir, in the days of the Black Hawk war, I fought,
bled, and came away. Speaking of General Cass&#8217;s career,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
reminds me of my own. I was not at Stillman&#8217;s defeat, but
I was about as near it as Cass to Hull&#8217;s surrender; and like
him, I saw the place very soon afterward. It is quite certain
I did not break my sword, for I had none to break; but I
bent a musket pretty badly on one occasion. If Cass broke
his sword, the idea is, he broke it in desperation; I bent the
musket by accident. If General Cass went in advance of me
in picking whortleberries, I guess I surpassed him in charges
upon the wild onions. If he saw any live, fighting Indians,
it was more than I did, but I had a good many bloody struggles
with the mosquitoes; and although I never fainted from
loss of blood, I can truly say I was often very hungry.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Speaker, if I should ever conclude to doff whatever
our Democratic friends may suppose there is of black-cockade
Federalism about me, and, thereupon, they should take me
up as their candidate for the Presidency, I protest they shall
not make fun of me as they have of General Cass, by attempting
to write me into a military hero.&#8221;</p>

<p>This bit of adventure over, Mr. Lincoln&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;who had determined
to become a lawyer, in common with most energetic,
enterprising young men of that period and section&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;embarked
in politics, warmly espousing the cause of Henry Clay, in a
State at that time decidedly opposed to his great leader, and
received a gratifying evidence of his personal popularity where
he was best known, in securing an almost unanimous vote in
his own precinct in Sangamon county as a candidate for representative
in the State Legislature, although a little later in
the same canvass General Jackson, the Democratic candidate
for the Presidency, led his competitor, Clay, one hundred and
fifty-five votes.</p>

<p>While pursuing his law studies, he engaged in land surveying
as a means of support. In 1834, not yet having been
admitted to the bar&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;a backwoodsman in manner, dress, and
expression&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;tall, lank, and by no means prepossessing&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;he
was first elected to the Legislature of his adopted State,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
being the youngest member, with a single exception. During
this session he rarely took the floor to speak, content to play
the part of an observer rather than of an actor. It was at
this period that he became acquainted with Stephen A.
Douglas, then a recent immigrant from Vermont, in connection
with whom he was destined to figure so prominently
before the country.</p>

<p>In 1836, he was elected for a second term. During this
session, he put upon record, together with one of his colleagues,
his views relative to slavery, in the following protest,
bearing date March 3d, 1837:&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;</p>

<p>&#8220;Resolutions upon the subject of domestic slavery having
passed both branches of the General Assembly, at its present
session, the undersigned hereby protest against the passage
of the same.</p>

<p>&#8220;They believe that the institution of slavery is founded on
both injustice and bad policy; but that the promulgation of
abolition doctrines tends rather to increase than abate its
evils.</p>

<p>&#8220;They believe that the Congress of the United States has
no power, under the Constitution, to interfere with the institution
of slavery in the different States.</p>

<p>&#8220;They believe that the Congress of the United States has
the power, under the Constitution, to abolish slavery in the
District of Columbia; but that the power ought not to be
exercised, unless at the request of the people of said district.&#8221;</p>

<p>In 1838 and 1840, he was again elected and received the
vote of his party for the speakership. First elected at
twenty-five, he had been continued so long as his inclination
allowed, and until by his kind manners, his ability, and unquestioned
integrity, he had won a position, when but a little
past thirty, as the virtual leader of his party in Illinois. His
reputation as a close and logical debater had been established;
his native talent as an orator had been developed; his earnest
zeal for his party had brought around him troops of friends;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
while his acknowledged goodness of heart had knit many to
him, who, upon purely political grounds, would have held
themselves aloof.</p>

<p>While a member of the Legislature, he had devoted himself,
as best he could&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;considering the necessity he was under
of eking out a support for himself, and the demands made
upon his time by his political associates&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;to mastering his
chosen profession, and in 1836 was admitted to practice.
Securing at once a good amount of business, he began to
rise as a most effective jury advocate, who could readily
perceive, and promptly avail himself of, the turning points of
a case. A certain quaint humor, withal, which he was wont
to employ in illustration&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;combined with his sterling, practical
sense, going straight to the core of things&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;stamped him
as an original. Disdaining the tricks of the mere rhetorician,
he spoke from the heart to the heart, and was universally
regarded by those with whom he came in contact as every
inch a man, in the best and broadest sense of that term. His
thoughts, his manner, his address were eminently his own.
Affecting none of the cant of the demagogue, the people
trusted him, revered him as one of the best, if not the best,
among them. Their sympathies were his&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;their weal his
desire, their interests a common stock with his own.</p>

<p>Having permanently located himself at Springfield, the
seat of Sangamon county&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;which ever after he called his
home&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;he devoted himself to the practice of his profession,
and on the 4th of November, 1842, married Mary Todd,
daughter of the Hon. Robert S. Todd of Lexington, Kentucky,
a lady of accomplished manners and refined social
tastes.</p>

<p>Although he had determined to retire from the political
arena and taste the sweets which a life with one&#8217;s own family
can alone secure, his earnest wishes were at length overruled
by the as earnest demands of that party with the success
of which he firmly believed his country&#8217;s best interests identified,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
and in 1844 he thoroughly canvassed his State in
behalf of Clay&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;afterward passing into Indiana, and daily
addressing immense gatherings until the day of election.
Over the defeat of the great Kentuckian he sorrowed as one
almost without hope; feeling it, indeed, far more keenly than
his generous nature would have done, had it been a merely
personal discomfiture.</p>

<p>Two years later, in 1846, Mr. Lincoln was persuaded to
accept the Whig nomination for Congress in the Sangamon
district, and was elected by an unprecedently large majority.
Texas had meanwhile been annexed; the Mexican war was
in progress; the Tariff of 1842 had been repealed.</p>

<p>With the opening of the Thirtieth Congress&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;December
6th, 1847&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;Mr. Lincoln took his seat in the lower house of
Congress, Stephen A. Douglas also appearing for the first
time as a member of the Senate.</p>

Declaration of Independence&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;Result of the Contest.</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. Lincoln was early recognized as one of the foremost
of the Western men upon the floor of the House. His
Congressional record is that of a Whig of those days.
Believing that Mr. Polk&#8217;s administration had mismanaged
affairs with Mexico at the outset, he, in common with others
of his party, was unwilling, while voting supplies and favoring
suitable rewards for our gallant soldiers, to be forced
into an unqualified indorsement of the war with that country
from its beginning to its close.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
Accordingly, December 22d, 1847, he introduced a series of
resolutions of inquiry concerning the origin of the war, calling
for definite official information, which were laid over under
the rule, and never acted upon. Upon a test question on
abandoning the war, without any material result accomplished,
he voted with the minority in favor of laying that
resolution upon the table.</p>

<p>In all questions bearing upon the matter of internal
improvements, he took an active interest. He took manly
ground in favor of the unrestricted right of petition, and
favored a liberal policy toward the people in disposing of
the public lands. He exerted himself during the canvass
of 1848, to secure the election of General Taylor, delivering
several effective campaign speeches in New England and
the West.</p>

<p>At the second session of the Thirtieth Congress, he voted
in favor of laying upon the table a resolution instructing the
Committee on the District of Columbia to report a bill prohibiting
the slave-trade in the District, and subsequently read
a substitute which he favored. This substitute contained the
form of a bill enacting that no person not already within the
District, should be held in slavery therein, and providing for
the gradual emancipation of the slaves already within the
District, with compensation to the owners, if a majority of
the legal voters of the District should assent to the act, at
an election to be holden for the purpose. It made an exception
of the right of citizens of the slave-holding States
coming to the District on public business, to &#8220;be attended
into and out of said District, and while there, by the necessary
servants of themselves and their families.&#8221;</p>

<p>In regard to the grant of public lands to the new States,
to aid in the construction of railways and canals, he favored
the interests of his own constituents, under such restrictions
as the proper scope of these grants required.</p>

<p>Having declined to be a candidate for re-election, he retired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
once more to private life, resuming the professional practice
which had been temporarily interrupted by his public duties,
and taking no active part in politics through the period of
General Taylor&#8217;s administration, or in any of the exciting
scenes of 1850.</p>

<p>The introduction of the Kansas-Nebraska bill by Stephen
A. Douglas, in 1854, aroused him from his repose, and
summoned him once more to battle for the right. In the
canvass of that year, he was one of the most active leaders
of the anti-Nebraska movement, addressing the people repeatedly
from the stump, with all his characteristic earnestness
and energy, and powerfully aided in effecting the
remarkable political changes of that year in Illinois.</p>

<p>The Legislature that year having to choose a United States
Senator, and for the first time in the history of the State, the
election of one opposed to the Democratic party being within
the reach of possibility, Mr. Lincoln, although the first
choice of the great body of the opposition, with characteristic
self-sacrificing disposition, appealed to his old Whig friends
to go over in a solid body to Mr. Trumbull, a man of Democratic
antecedents, who could command the full vote of the
anti-Nebraska Democrats; and the latter was consequently
elected. Mr. Lincoln was subsequently offered the nomination
for Governor of Illinois, but declined the honor in favor
of Col. William H. Bissell, who was elected by a decisive
majority.</p>

<p>In the formation of the Republican party as such, Mr.
Lincoln bore an active and influential part, his name being
presented, but ineffectually, at the first National Convention
of that party, for Vice-President; laboring earnestly during
the canvass of 1856, for the election of General Fremont,
whose electoral ticket he headed.</p>

<p>After Mr. Douglas had taken ground against Mr. Buchanan&#8217;s
administration relative to the so-called Lecompton
Constitution of Kansas, and had received the indorsement of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
the Democratic party of Illinois&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;his re-election as Senator
depending upon the result of the State election in 1858&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;the
Republican Convention of that year with shouts of
applause, unanimously resolved that Abraham Lincoln was
&#8220;the first and only choice of the Republicans of Illinois for
the United States Senate, as the successor of Stephen A.
Douglas.&#8221; At the close of the proceedings, he delivered the
following speech, which struck the key-note of his contest
with Senator Douglas, one of the most exciting and remarkable
ever witnessed in this country:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Gentlemen of the Convention</span>:&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;If we could first know
where we are, and whither we are tending, we could then
better judge what to do, and how to do it. We are now far
on into the fifth year, since a policy was initiated, with the
avowed object, and confident promise of putting an end to
slavery agitation. Under the operation of that policy, that
agitation had not only not ceased, but has constantly augmented.
In my opinion, it will not cease, until a crisis shall
have been reached, and passed. &#8216;A house divided against
itself can not stand.&#8217; I believe this Government can not
endure, permanently, half slave and half free. I do not expect
the Union to be dissolved&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;I do not expect the house to
fall&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;but I do expect it will cease to be divided. It will become
all one thing, or all the other. Either the opponents of
slavery will arrest the further spread of it, and place it where
the public mind shall rest in the belief that it is in course of
ultimate extinction, or its advocates will push it forward, till
it shall become alike lawful in all the States, old as well as
new&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;North as well as South.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have we no tendency to the latter condition? Let any
one who doubts, carefully contemplate that now almost complete
legal combination&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;piece of machinery, so to speak&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;compounded
of the Nebraska doctrine, and the Dred Scott
decision. Let him consider not only what work the machinery
is adapted to do, and how well adapted, but also let him study<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
the history of its construction, and trace, if he can, or rather
fail, if he can, to trace the evidences of design, and concert of
action, among its chief master-workers from the beginning.</p>

<p>&#8220;But, so far, Congress only had acted; and an indorsement
by the people, real or apparent, was indispensable, to save
the point already gained, and give chance for more. The new
year of 1854 found slavery excluded from more than half the
States by State Constitutions, and from most of the national
territory by Congressional prohibition. Four days later commenced
the struggle, which ended in repealing that Congressional
prohibition. This opened all the national territory to
slavery, and was the first point gained.</p>

<p>&#8220;This necessity had not been overlooked, but had been
provided for, as well as might be, in the notable argument of
&#8216;<i>squatter sovereignty</i>,&#8217; otherwise called &#8216;<i>sacred right of self-government</i>,&#8217;
which latter phrase, though expressive of the
only rightful basis of any government, was so perverted in
this attempted use of it as to amount to just this: that if any
one man choose to enslave another, no third man shall be
allowed to object. That argument was incorporated into the
Nebraska Bill itself, in the language which follows: &#8216;It being
the true intent and meaning of this act not to legislate slavery
into any Territory or State, nor exclude it therefrom; but to
leave the people thereof perfectly free to form and regulate
their domestic institutions in their own way, subject only to
the Constitution of the United States.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then opened the roar of loose declamation in favor of
&#8216;squatter sovereignty,&#8217; and &#8216;sacred right of self-government.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;But,&#8217; said opposition members, &#8216;let us be more specific&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;let
us <i>amend</i> the bill so as to expressly declare that the
people of the territory <i>may</i> exclude slavery.&#8217; &#8216;Not we,&#8217; said
the friends of the measure; and down they voted the amendment.</p>

<p>&#8220;While the Nebraska Bill was passing through Congress,
a law case, involving the question of a negro&#8217;s freedom, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
reason of his owner having voluntarily taken him first into a
free State and then a territory covered by the Congressional
prohibition, and held him as a slave&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;for a long time in each&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;was
passing through the U.&nbsp;S. Circuit Court for the District
of Missouri; and both the Nebraska Bill and law suit were
brought to a decision in the same month of May, 1854. The
negro&#8217;s name was &#8216;Dred Scott,&#8217; which name now designates
the decision finally made in the case.</p>

<p>&#8220;Before the then next Presidential election case, the law
came to, and was argued in the Supreme Court of the United
States; but the decision of it was deferred until <i>after</i> the
election. Still, <i>before</i> the election, Senator Trumbull, on the
floor of the Senate, requests the leading advocate of the
Nebraska Bill to state <i>his opinion</i> whether a people of a territory
can constitutionally exclude slavery from their limits;
and the latter answers, &#8216;That is a question for the Supreme
Court.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;The election came. Mr. Buchanan was elected, and the
<i>indorsement</i>, such as it was, secured. That was the <i>second</i>
point gained. The indorsement, however, fell short of a
clear popular majority by nearly four hundred thousand votes,
and so, perhaps, was not overwhelmingly reliable and satisfactory.
The outgoing President in his last annual message,
as impressively as possible echoed back upon the people the
weight and authority of the indorsement.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Supreme Court met again; did not announce their
decision, but ordered a re-argument. The Presidential inauguration
came, and still no decision of the court; but the
incoming President, in his Inaugural Address, fervently exhorted
the people to abide by the forthcoming decision, <i>whatever
it might be</i>. Then, in a few days came the decision.</p>

<p>&#8220;This was the third point gained.</p>

<p>&#8220;The reputed author of the Nebraska Bill finds an early
occasion to make a speech at this capitol indorsing the Dred
Scott decision and vehemently denouncing all opposition to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
it. The new President, too, seizes the early occasion of the
Silliman letter to indorse and strongly construe that decision,
and to express his astonishment that any different view had
ever been entertained. At length a squabble springs up
between the President and the author of the Nebraska Bill
on the mere question of fact, whether the Lecompton Constitution
was or was not, in any just sense, made by the people
of Kansas; and, in that squabble, the latter declares that all
he wants is a fair vote for the people, and that he cares not
whether slavery be voted down or voted up. I do not understand
his declaration that he cares not whether slavery be
voted down or voted up, to be intended by him other than as
an apt definition of the policy he would impress upon the
public mind&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;the principle for which he declares he has
suffered much, and is ready to suffer to the end.</p>

<p>&#8220;And well may he cling to that principle. If he has any
parental feeling, well may he cling to it. That principle is
the only shred left of his original Nebraska doctrine. Under
the Dred Scott decision, &#8216;squatter sovereignty&#8217; squatted out
of existence, tumbled down like temporary scaffolding&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;like
the mould at the foundry, served through one blast, and fell
back into loose sand&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;helped to carry an election, and then
was kicked to the winds. His late joint struggle with the
Republicans, against the Lecompton Constitution, involves
nothing of the original Nebraska doctrine. That struggle
was made on a point&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;the right of a people to make their
own Constitution&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;upon which he and the Republicans have
never differed.</p>

<p>&#8220;The several points of the Dred Scott decision, in connection
with Senator Douglas&#8217;s &#8216;care not&#8217; policy, constitute the
piece of machinery in its present state of advancement. The
working points of that machinery are:</p>

<p>&#8220;First, That no negro slave, imported as such from Africa,
and no descendant of such, can ever be a citizen of any State<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
in the sense of that term as used in the Constitution of the
United States.</p>

<p>&#8220;This point is made in order to deprive the negro, in
every possible event, of the benefit of this provision of the
United States Constitution, which declares that&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;&#8216;The citizens
of each State shall be entitled to all the privileges and immunities
of citizens in the several States.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Secondly, that &#8216;subject to the Constitution of the United
States,&#8217; neither Congress nor a Territorial Legislature can
exclude slavery from any United States Territory.</p>

<p>&#8220;This point is made in order that individual men may fill
up the Territories with slaves, without danger of losing them
as property, and thus to enhance the chances of permanency
to the institution through all the future.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thirdly, that whether the holding a negro in actual
slavery in a free State makes him free, as against the holder,
the United States courts will not decide, but will leave it to be
decided by the courts of any slave State the negro may be
forced into by the master.</p>

<p>&#8220;This point is made, not to be pressed immediately; but,
if acquiesced in for a while, and apparently indorsed by the
people at an election, then, to sustain the logical conclusion
that what Dred Scott&#8217;s master might lawfully do with Dred
Scott, in the free State of Illinois, every other master may
lawfully do with any other one, or one thousand slaves, in
Illinois, or in any other free State.</p>

<p>&#8220;Auxiliary to all this, and working hand in hand with it,
the Nebraska doctrine, or what is left of it, is to educate and
mould public opinion, at least Northern public opinion, not to
care whether slavery is voted down or voted up.</p>

<p>&#8220;This shows exactly where we now are, and partially also,
whither we are tending.</p>

<p>&#8220;It will throw additional light on the latter, to go back and
run the mind over the string of historical facts already
stated. Several things will now appear less dark and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
mysterious than they did when they were transpiring. The
people were to be left &#8220;perfectly free,&#8221; &#8220;subject only to the
Constitution.&#8221; What the Constitution had to do with it,
outsiders could not then see. Plainly enough now, it was an
exactly fitted niche for the Dred Scott decision afterward to
come in, and declare that perfect freedom of the people to be
just no freedom at all.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why was the amendment expressly declaring the right
of the people to exclude slavery, voted down? Plainly
enough now, the adoption of it would have spoiled the niche
for the Dred Scott decision.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why was the court decision held up? Why even a
Senator&#8217;s individual opinion withheld till after the Presidential
election? Plainly enough now; the speaking out
then would have damaged the &#8220;<i>perfectly free</i>&#8221; argument
upon which the election was to be carried.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why the outgoing President&#8217;s felicitation on the indorsement?
Why the delay of a re-argument? Why the incoming
President&#8217;s advance exhortation in favor of the decision?
These things look like the cautious patting and
petting of a spirited horse preparatory to mounting him,
when it is dreaded that he may give the rider a fall. And
why the hasty after-indorsements of the decision, by the
President and others?</p>

<p>&#8220;We cannot absolutely know that all these exact adaptations
are the result of pre-concert. But when we see a lot
of framed timbers, different portions of which we know have
been gotten out, at different times and places, and by different
workmen&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;Stephen, Franklin, Roger, and James, for instance&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;and
when we see these timbers joined together, and
see they exactly make the frame of a house or a mill, all the
tenons and mortices exactly fitting, and all the lengths and
proportions of the different pieces exactly adapted to their
respective places, and not a piece too many or too few&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;not
omitting even scaffolding&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;or, if a single piece be lacking,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
we can see the place in the frame exactly fitted and prepared
to yet bring such piece in&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;in such a case, we find it impossible
not to believe that Stephen and Franklin and Roger and
James all understood one another from the beginning, and all
worked upon a common plan or draft drawn up before the
first blow was struck.</p>

<p>&#8220;It should not be overlooked that, by the Nebraska bill,
the people of a State as well as Territory, were to be left
&#8216;<i>perfectly free</i>,&#8217; &#8216;<i>subject only to the Constitution</i>.&#8217; Why
mention a State? They were legislating for Territories, and
not for or about States. Certainly the people of a State are
and ought to be subject to the Constitution of the United
States; but why is mention of this lugged into this merely
territorial law? Why are the people of a Territory and the
people of a State therein lumped together, and their relation
to the Constitution therein treated as being precisely the
same?</p>

<p>&#8220;While the opinion of the court, by Chief Justice Taney,
in the Dred Scott case, and the separate opinions of all the
concurring judges, expressly declare that the Constitution of
the United States neither permits Congress nor a Territorial
Legislature, to exclude slavery from any United States
Territory, they all omit to declare whether or not the same
Constitution permits a State, or the people of a State, to
exclude it. <i>Possibly</i>, this was a mere <i>omission</i>; but who
can be quite sure, if McLean or Curtis had sought to get
into the opinion a declaration of unlimited power in the
people of a State to exclude slavery from their limits, just as
Chase and Mace sought to get such declaration, in behalf of
the people of a Territory, into the Nebraska bill&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;I ask, who
can be quite sure that it would not have been voted down, in
the one case as it had been in the other.</p>

<p>&#8220;The nearest approach to the point of declaring the power
of a State over slavery, is made by Judge Nelson. He
approaches it more than once, using the precise idea, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
almost the language, too, of the Nebraska Act. On one
occasion his exact language is, &#8216;except in cases where the
power is restrained by the Constitution of the United States,
the law of the State is supreme over the subject of slavery
within its jurisdiction.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;In what cases the power of the State is so restrained by
the United States Constitution, is left an open question, precisely
as the same question, as to the restraint on the power
of the Territories was left open in the Nebraska Act. Put
that and that together, and we have another nice little niche,
which we may ere long, see filled with another Supreme
Court decision, declaring that the Constitution of the United
States does not permit a State to exclude slavery from its
limits. And this may especially be expected if the doctrine
of &#8216;care not whether slavery be voted down or voted up,&#8217;
shall gain upon the public mind sufficiently to give promise
that such a decision can be maintained when made.</p>

<p>&#8220;Such a decision is all that slavery now lacks of being
alike lawful in all the States. Welcome or unwelcome, such
decision is probably coming, and will soon be upon us,
unless the power of the present political dynasty shall be met
and overthrown. We shall lie down pleasantly dreaming
that the people of Missouri are on the verge of making
their State free; and we shall awake to the reality, instead,
that the Supreme Court has made Illinois a slave State.</p>

<p>&#8220;To meet and overthrow the power of that dynasty, is the
work now before all those who would prevent that consummation.
That is what we have to do. But how can we
best do it?</p>

<p>&#8220;There are those who denounce us openly to their own
friends, and yet whisper softly, that Senator Douglas is the
<i>aptest</i> instrument there is, with which to effect that object.
They do not tell us, nor has he told us, that he wishes any
such object to be effected. They wish us to infer all, from
the facts that he now has a little quarrel with the present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
head of the dynasty; and that he has regularly voted with
us, on a single point, upon which he and we have never
differed.</p>

<p>&#8220;They remind us that <i>he</i> is a very <i>great man</i>, and that
the largest of us are very small ones. Let this be granted.
But &#8216;a <i>living dog</i> is better than a <i>dead lion</i>.&#8217; Judge
Douglas, if not a <i>dead</i> lion for this work, is at least a <i>caged</i>
and <i>toothless</i> one. How can he oppose the advances of
slavery? He don&#8217;t care anything about it. His avowed
mission is impressing the &#8216;public heart&#8217; to care nothing
about it.</p>

<p>&#8220;A leading Douglas Democrat newspaper thinks Douglas&#8217;s
superior talent will be needed to resist the revival of the
African slave-trade. Does Douglas believe an effort to
revive that trade is approaching? He has not said so.
Does he <i>really</i> think so? But if it is, how can he resist it?
For years he has labored to prove it a <i>sacred right</i> of white
men to take negro slaves into the new Territories. Can he
possibly show that it is less a sacred right to buy them where
they can be bought cheapest? And, unquestionably they
can be bought cheaper in Africa than in Virginia.</p>

<p>&#8220;He has done all in his power to reduce the whole question
of slavery to one of a mere right of property; and as such,
how can he oppose the foreign slave-trade&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;how can he
refuse that trade in that &#8216;property&#8217; shall be &#8216;perfectly
free&#8217;&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;unless he does it as a <i>protection</i> to the home production?
And as the home <i>producers</i> will probably not ask the
protection, he will be wholly without a ground of opposition.</p>

<p>&#8220;Senator Douglas holds, we know, that a man may
rightfully be wiser to-day than he was yesterday&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;that
he may rightfully change when he finds himself wrong. But
can we for that reason run ahead and infer that he will make
any particular change, of which he himself has given no
intimation? Can we safely base our action upon any such
vague inferences?</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;Now, as ever, I wish not to misrepresent Judge Douglas&#8217;s
position, question his motives, or do aught that can be personally
offensive to him. Whenever, <i>if ever</i>, he and we can
come together on <i>principle</i>, so that our great cause may
have assistance from his great ability, I hope to have interposed
no adventitious obstacle.</p>

<p>&#8220;But clearly, he is not now with us&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;he does not pretend
to be&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;he does not promise ever to be. Our cause, then,
must be intrusted to, and conducted by its own undoubted
friends&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;those whose hands are free, whose hearts are in the
work&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;who do care for the result.</p>

<p>&#8220;Two years ago the Republicans of the nation mustered
over thirteen hundred thousand strong. We did this under
the single impulse of resistance to a common danger, with
every external circumstance against us. Of strange, discordant,
and even hostile elements, we gathered from the
four winds, and formed and fought the battle through, under
the constant hot fire of a disciplined, proud and pampered
enemy. Did we brave all then to falter now?&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;<i>now</i>&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;when
that same enemy is wavering, dissevered and belligerent?</p>

<p>&#8220;The result is not doubtful. We shall not fail&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;if we
stand firm, we shall not fail. <i>Wise counsels</i> may <i>accelerate</i>
or <i>mistakes delay</i> it, but, sooner or later, the victory is <i>sure</i>
to come.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>In this most vigorously prosecuted canvass Illinois was
stumped throughout its length and breadth by both candidates
and their respective advocates, and the struggle was watched
with interest by the country at large. From county to
county, from township to township, and village to village the
two champions travelled, frequently in the same car or carriage,
and in the presence of immense crowds of men, women,
and children&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;for the wives and daughters of the hardy yeomanry
were naturally interested&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;argued, face to face, the
important points of their political belief and contended nobly
for the mastery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
In one of his speeches during this memorable campaign,
Mr. Lincoln paid the following tribute to the Declaration of
<span class="locked">Independence:&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;These communities, (the thirteen colonies,) by their
representatives in old Independence Hall, said to the world
of men, &#8216;we hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men
are born equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with
inalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the
pursuit of happiness.&#8217; This was their majestic interpretation
of the economy of the universe. This was their lofty, and
wise, and noble understanding of the justice of the Creator to
His creatures. Yes, gentlemen, to all His creatures, to the
whole great family of man. In their enlightened belief, nothing
stamped with the Divine image and likeness was sent
into the world to be trodden on, and degraded, and imbruted
by its fellows. They grasped not only the race of men then
living, but they reached forward and seized upon the furthest
posterity. They created a beacon to guide their children and
their children&#8217;s children, and the countless myriads who
should inhabit the earth in other ages. Wise statesmen as
they were, they knew the tendency of prosperity to breed
tyrants, and so they established these great self-evident
truths that when, in the distant future, some man, some faction,
some interest, should set up the doctrine that none but
rich men, or none but white men, or none but Anglo-Saxon
white men, were entitled to life, liberty, and the pursuit of
happiness, their posterity might look up again to the Declaration
of Independence, and take courage to renew the battle,
which their fathers began, so that truth, and justice, and
mercy, and all the humane and Christian virtues might not
be extinguished from the land; so that no man would hereafter
dare to limit and circumscribe the great principles on
which the temple of liberty was being built.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, my countrymen, if you have been taught doctrines
conflicting with the great landmarks of the Declaration of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
Independence; if you have listened to suggestions which
would take away from its grandeur, and mutilate the fair
symmetry of its proportions; if you have been inclined to believe
that all men are not created equal in those inalienable
rights enumerated by our chart of liberty, let me entreat you
to come back&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;return to the fountain whose waters spring
close by the blood of the Revolution. Think nothing of me,
take no thought for the political fate of any man whomsoever,
but come back to the truths that are in the Declaration of
Independence.</p>

<p>&#8220;You may do any thing with me you choose, if you will
but heed these sacred principles. You may not only defeat
me for the Senate, but you may take me and put me to death.
While pretending no indifference to earthly honors, I <i>do claim</i>
to be actuated in this contest by something higher than an
anxiety for office. I charge you to drop every paltry and
insignificant thought for any man&#8217;s success. It is nothing; I
am nothing; Judge Douglas is nothing. <i>But do not destroy
that immortal emblem of humanity&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;the Declaration of American
Independence.</i>&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>In the election which closed this contest, the Republican
candidate received 126,084 votes; the Douglas Democrats,
121,940; and the Lecompton Democrats, 5,091. Mr.
Douglas was, however, re-elected to the Senate by the Legislature,
in which, owing to the peculiar apportionment of the
legislative districts his supporters had a majority of eight
in joint ballot.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">Speeches in Ohio&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;Extract from his Cincinnati Speech&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;Visits the East&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;Celebrated
Speech at the Cooper Institute, New York&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;Interesting Incident.</p></blockquote>

<p>The issue of this contest with Douglas, seemingly a defeat,
was destined in due time to prove a decisive triumph. Mr.
Lincoln&#8217;s reputation as a skillful debater and master of political
fence was secure, and admitted throughout the land.
During the year ensuing he again devoted himself almost
exclusively to professional labors, delivering, however, in the
campaign of 1859, at the earnest solicitation of the Republicans
of Ohio, two most convincing speeches in that State,
one at Columbus, and the other at Cincinnati.</p>

<p>In his speech in the latter city, alluding to the certainty of
a speedy Republican triumph in the nation, Mr. Lincoln thus
sketched what he regarded as the inevitable results of such
a victory:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;I will tell you, so far as I am authorized to speak for the
opposition, what we mean to do with you. We mean to
treat you, as nearly as we possibly can, as Washington,
Jefferson, and Madison treated you. We mean to leave you
alone, and in no way interfere with your institution; to abide
by all and every compromise of the Constitution; and, in a
word, coming back to the original proposition to treat you,
so far as degenerated men (if we have degenerated) may,
imitating the example of those noble fathers, Washington,
Jefferson, and Madison. We mean to remember that you are
as good as we; that there is no difference between us other
than the difference of circumstances. We mean to recognize<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
and bear in mind always that you have as good hearts in
your bosoms as other people, or as we claim to have, and
treat you accordingly. We mean to marry your girls when
we have a chance&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;the white ones I mean&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;and I have the
honor to inform you that I once did get a chance in that
way.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have told you what we mean to do. I want to know,
now, when that thing takes place, what you mean to do. I
often hear it intimated that you mean to divide the Union
whenever a Republican, or any thing like it, is elected President
of the United States. [A voice, &#8216;That is so.&#8217;] &#8216;That
is so,&#8217; one of them says. I wonder if he is a Kentuckian?
[A voice, &#8216;He is a Douglas man.&#8217;] Well, then, I want to
know what you are going to do with your half of it? Are
you going to split the Ohio down through, and push your
half off a piece? Or are you going to keep it right alongside
of us outrageous fellows? Or are you going to build up a wall
some way between your country and ours, by which that
movable property of yours can&#8217;t come over here any more,
and you lose it? Do you think you can better yourselves on
that subject, by leaving us here under no obligation whatever
to return those specimens of your movable property that
come hither? You have divided the Union because we
would not do right with you, as you think, upon that subject;
when we cease to be under obligations to do any thing for
you, how much better off do you think you will be? Will
you make war upon us and kill us all? Why, gentlemen, I
think you are as gallant and as brave men as live; that you
can fight as bravely in a good cause, man for man, as any
other people living; that you have shown yourselves capable
of this upon various occasions; but, man for man, you are
not better than we are, and there are not so many of you as
there are of us. You will never make much of a hand at
whipping us. If we were fewer in numbers than you, I
think that you could whip us; if we were equal it would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
likely be a drawn battle; but being inferior in numbers, you
will make nothing by attempting to master us.</p>

<p>&#8220;I say that we must not interfere with the institution of
Slavery in the States where it exists, because the Constitution
forbids it, and the general welfare does not require us to do
so. We must not withhold an efficient fugitive slave law
because the Constitution requires us, as I understand it, not
to withhold such a law, but we must prevent the outspreading
of the institution, because neither the constitution nor the
general welfare requires us to extend it. We must prevent
the revival of the African slave-trade and the enacting by
Congress of a Territorial slave code. We must prevent each
of these things being done by either Congresses or Courts.
<span class="smcap">The people of these United States are the rightful
masters of both Congresses and Courts</span>, not to overthrow
the Constitution, but to overthrow the men who pervert
that Constitution.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>In the spring of 1860, Mr. Lincoln yielded to the urgent
calls which came to him from the East for his aid in the exciting
canvasses then in progress in that section, and spoke
at various places in Connecticut, New Hampshire, and Rhode
Island, and also in New York city, and was everywhere
warmly welcomed by immense audiences.</p>

<p>Without doubt, one of the greatest speeches of his life was
that delivered by him in the Cooper Institute, in New York,
on the 27th of February, 1860, in the presence of a crowded
assembly which received him with the most enthusiastic
demonstrations. We subjoin a full report of this masterly
analysis of men and measures. After being introduced in
highly complimentary terms by the venerable William Cullen
Bryant, who presided on the occasion, he proceeded:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Mr. President and Fellow Citizens of New York</span>:&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;The
facts with which I shall deal this evening are mainly old
and familiar; nor is there any thing new in the general use
I shall make of them. If there shall be any novelty, it will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
be in the mode of presenting the facts, and the inferences and
observations following that presentation.</p>

<p>&#8220;In his speech last autumn, at Columbus, Ohio, as reported
in <i>The New York Times</i>, Senator Douglas said:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Our fathers, when they framed the Government under
which we live, understood this question just as well, and
even better than we do now.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;I fully indorse this and I adopt it as a text for this discourse.
I so adopt it because it furnishes a precise and
agreed starting point for the discussion between Republicans
and that wing of Democracy headed by Senator Douglas. It
simply leaves the inquiry: &#8216;What was the understanding
those fathers had of the questions mentioned?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is the frame of Government under which we live?</p>

<p>&#8220;The answer must be: &#8216;The Constitution of the United
States.&#8217; That Constitution consists of the original, framed
in 1787 (and under which the present Government first went
into operation), and twelve subsequently framed amendments,
the first ten of which were framed in 1789.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who were our fathers that framed the Constitution? I
suppose the &#8216;thirty-nine&#8217; who signed the original instrument
may be fairly called our fathers who framed that part of the
present Government. It is almost exactly true to say they
framed it, and it is altogether true to say they fairly represented
the opinion and sentiment of the whole nation at that
time. Their names being familiar to nearly all, and accessible
to quite all, need not now be repeated.</p>

<p>&#8220;I take these &#8216;thirty-nine,&#8217; for the present, as being &#8216;our
fathers who framed the Government under which we live.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is the question which, according to the text, those
fathers understood just as well, and even better than we do
now?</p>

<p>&#8220;It is this: Does the proper division of local from federal
authority, or any thing in the Constitution, forbid our Federal
Government control as to slavery in our Federal Territories?</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;Upon this, Douglas holds the affirmative, and Republicans
the negative. This affirmative and denial form an issue; and
this issue&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;this question&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;is precisely what the text declares
our fathers understood better than we.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us now inquire whether the &#8216;thirty-nine,&#8217; or any of
them, ever acted upon this question; and if they did, how
they acted upon it&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;how they expressed that better understanding.</p>

<p>&#8220;In 1784&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;three years before the Constitution&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;the
United States then owning the Northwestern Territory, and
no other&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;the Congress of the Confederation had before them
the question of prohibiting slavery in that Territory; and
four of the &#8216;thirty-nine&#8217; who afterward framed the Constitution
were in that Congress, and voted on that question. Of
these, Roger Sherman, Thomas Mifflin, and Hugh Williamson
voted for the prohibition&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;thus showing that, in their
understanding, no line dividing local from federal authority,
nor any thing else, properly forbade the Federal Government
to control as to slavery in federal territory. The other of the
four&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;James McHenry&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;voted against the prohibition, showing
that, for some cause, he thought it improper to vote
for it.</p>

<p>&#8220;In 1787, still before the Constitution, but while the Convention
was in session framing it, and while the Northwestern
Territory still was the only territory owned by the
United States&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;the same question of prohibiting slavery in
the territory again came before the Congress of the Confederation;
and three more of the &#8216;thirty-nine&#8217; who afterward
signed the Constitution, were in that Congress, and voted on
the question. They were William Blount, William Few,
and Abraham Baldwin; and they all voted for the prohibition&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;thus
showing that, in their understanding, no line dividing
local from federal authority, nor any thing else, properly forbids
the Federal Government to control as to slavery in
federal territory. This time the prohibition became a law,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
being part of what is now well known as the Ordinance
of &#8217;87.</p>

<p>&#8220;The question of federal control of slavery in the territories,
seems not to have been directly before the Convention which
framed the original Constitution; and hence it is not recorded
that the &#8216;thirty-nine&#8217; or any of them, while engaged on that
instrument, expressed any opinion on that precise question.</p>

<p>&#8220;In 1789, by the First congress which sat under the Constitution,
an act was passed to enforce the Ordinance of &#8217;87
including the prohibition of slavery in the Northwestern
Territory. The bill for this act was reported by one of the
&#8216;thirty-nine,&#8217; Thomas Fitzsimmons, then a member of the
House of Representatives from Pennsylvania. It went
through all its stages without a word of opposition, and
finally passed both branches without yeas and nays, which is
equivalent to an unanimous passage. In this Congress there
were sixteen of the &#8216;thirty-nine&#8217; fathers who framed the original
Constitution. They were John Langdon, Nicholas Gilman,
Wm. S. Johnson, Roger Sherman, Robert Morris,
Thos. Fitzsimmons, William Few, Abraham Baldwin, Rufus
King, William Patterson, George Clymer, Richard Bassett,
George Read, Pierce Butler, Daniel Carrol, James Madison.</p>

<p>&#8220;This shows that, in their understanding, no line dividing
local from federal authority, nor any thing in the Constitution,
properly forbade Congress to prohibit slavery in the federal
territory; else both their fidelity to correct principle, and their
oath to support the Constitution, would have constrained
them to oppose the prohibition.</p>

<p>&#8220;Again, George Washington, another of the &#8216;thirty-nine,&#8217;
was then President of the United States, and, as such, approved
and signed the bill, thus completing its validity as a
law, and thus showing that, in his understanding, no line
dividing local from federal authority, nor any thing in the
Constitution, forbade the Federal Government to control as
to slavery in Federal territory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
&#8220;No great while after the adoption of the original Constitution,
North Carolina ceded to the Federal Government the
country now constituting the State of Tennessee; and a few
years later Georgia ceded that which now constitutes the
States of Mississippi and Alabama. In both deeds of cession
it was made a condition by the ceding States that the Federal
Government should not prohibit slavery in the ceded country.
Besides this, slavery was then actually in the ceded country.
Under these circumstances, Congress, on taking charge of
these countries did not absolutely prohibit slavery within
them. But they did interfere with it&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;take control of it&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;even
there, to a certain extent. In 1798, Congress organized
the Territory of Mississippi. In the act of organization they
prohibited the bringing of slaves into the Territory, from any
place without the United States, by fine and giving freedom
to slaves so brought. This act passed both branches of
Congress without yeas and nays. In that Congress were
three of the &#8216;thirty-nine&#8217; who framed the original Constitution.
They were John Langdon, George Read, and Abraham
Baldwin. They all, probably, voted for it. Certainly they
would have placed their opposition to it upon record, if, in
their understanding, any line dividing local from Federal
authority, or any thing in the Constitution, properly forbade
the Federal Government to control as to slavery in Federal
territory.</p>

<p>&#8220;In 1803, the Federal Government purchased the Louisiana
country. Our former territorial acquisitions came from
certain of our own States; but this Louisiana country was
acquired from a foreign nation. In 1804, Congress gave a
territorial organization to that part of it which now constitutes
the State of Louisiana. New Orleans, lying within
that part, was an old and comparatively large city. There
were other considerable towns and settlements, and slavery
was extensively and thoroughly intermingled with the people.
Congress did not, in the Territorial Act, prohibit slavery;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
but they did interfere with it&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;take control of it&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;in a more
marked and extensive way than they did in the case of Mississippi.
The substance of the provision therein made, in
relation to slaves, was:</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>First.</i> That no slave should be imported into the territory
from foreign parts.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Second.</i> That no slave should be carried into it who had
been imported into the United States since the first day of
May, 1798.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Third.</i> That no slave should be carried into it, except by
the owner, and for his own use as a settler; the penalty in all
the cases being a fine upon the violator of the law, and freedom
to the slave.</p>

<p>&#8220;This act also was passed without yeas and nays. In the
Congress which passed it, there were two of the &#8216;thirty-nine.&#8217;
They were Abraham Baldwin and Jonathan Dayton. As
stated in the case of Mississippi, it is probable they both
voted for it. They would not have allowed it to pass without
recording their opposition to it, if, in their understanding, it
violated either the line proper dividing local from Federal
authority or any provision of the Constitution.</p>

<p>&#8220;In 1819&ndash;20, came and passed the Missouri question.
Many votes were taken, by yeas and nays, in both branches
of Congress, upon the various phases of the general question.
Two of the &#8216;thirty-nine&#8217;&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;Rufus King and Charles Pinckney&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;were
members of that Congress. Mr. King steadily voted for
slavery prohibition and against all compromises, while Mr.
Pinckney as steadily voted against slavery prohibition and
against all compromises. By this Mr. King showed that, in
his understanding, no line dividing local from Federal authority,
nor any thing in the Constitution, was violated by
Congress prohibiting slavery in Federal territory; while Mr.
Pinckney, by his votes, showed that in his understanding
there was some sufficient reason for opposing such prohibition
in that case.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
&#8220;The cases I have mentioned are the only acts of the
&#8216;thirty-nine,&#8217; or of any of them, upon the direct issue, which
I have been able to discover.</p>

<p>&#8220;To enumerate the persons who thus acted, as being four
in 1784, three in 1787, seventeen in 1789, three in 1798, two
in 1804, and two in 1819&ndash;20&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;there would be thirty-one of
them. But this would be counting John Langdon, Roger
Sherman, William Few, Rufus King, and George Read, each
twice, and Abraham Baldwin four times. The true number
of those of the &#8216;thirty-nine&#8217; whom I have shown to have
acted upon the question, which, by the text they understood
better than we, is twenty-three, leaving sixteen not shown to
have acted upon it in any way.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, then, we have twenty-three out of our &#8216;thirty-nine&#8217;
fathers who framed the government under which we live,
who have, upon their official responsibility and their corporal
oaths, acted upon the very question which the text affirms
they &#8216;understood just as well, and even better than we do
now;&#8217; and twenty-one of them&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;a clear majority of the
&#8216;thirty-nine&#8217;&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;so acting upon it as to make them guilty of
gross political impropriety, and wilful perjury, if, in their
understanding, any proper division between local and Federal
authority, or any thing in the Constitution they had made
themselves, and sworn to support, forbade the Federal
Government to control as to slavery in the Federal territories.
Thus the twenty-one acted; and, as actions speak louder
than words, so actions under such responsibility speak still
louder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Two of the twenty-three voted against Congressional
prohibition of slavery in the Federal Territories, in the
instances in which they acted upon the question. But for
what reasons they so voted is not known. They may have
done so because they thought a proper division of local
from Federal authority, or some provision or principle of the
Constitution, stood in the way; or they may, without any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
such question, have voted against the prohibition, on what
appeared to them to be sufficient grounds of expediency. No
one who has sworn to support the Constitution, can conscientiously
vote for what he understands to be an unconstitutional
measure, however expedient he may think it; but
one may and ought to vote against a measure which he
deems constitutional, if, at the same time, he deems it inexpedient.
It, therefore, would be unsafe to set down even the
two who voted against the prohibition, as having done so
because, in their understanding, any proper division of local
from Federal authority, or any thing in the Constitution,
forbade the Federal Government to control as to slavery in
Federal Territory.</p>

<p>&#8220;The remaining sixteen of the &#8216;thirty-nine,&#8217; so far as I
have discovered, have left no record of their understanding
upon the direct question of Federal control of slavery in the
Federal Territories. But there is much reason to believe
that their understanding upon that question would not have
appeared different from that of their twenty-three compeers,
had it been manifested at all.</p>

<p>&#8220;For the purpose of adhering rigidly to the text, I have
purposely omitted whatever understanding may have been
manifested, by any person, however distinguished, other than
the &#8216;thirty-nine&#8217; fathers who framed the original Constitution;
and, for the same reason, I have also omitted whatever
understanding may have been manifested by any of the
&#8216;thirty-nine&#8217; even, on any other phase of the general question
of slavery. If we should look into their acts and declarations
on those other phases, as the foreign slave-trade, and
the morality and policy of slavery generally, it would appear
to us that on the direct question of Federal control of slavery
in Federal Territories, the sixteen, if they had acted at all,
would probably have acted just as the twenty-three did.
Among that sixteen were several of the most noted anti-slavery
men of those times&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;as Dr. Franklin, Alexander<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
Hamilton, and Governeur Morris&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;while there was not one
now known to have been otherwise, unless it may be John
Rutledge, of South Carolina.</p>

<p>&#8220;The sum of the whole is, that of our &#8216;thirty-nine&#8217; fathers
who framed the original Constitution, twenty-one&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;a clear
majority of the whole&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;certainly understood that no proper
division of local from Federal authority nor any part of the
Constitution, forbade the Federal Government to control
slavery in the Federal Territories, while all the rest probably
had the same understanding. Such, unquestionably, was the
understanding of our fathers who framed the original Constitution;
and the text affirms that they understood the question
better than we.</p>

<p>&#8220;But, so far, I have been considering the understanding of
the question manifested by the framers of the original Constitution.
In and by the original instrument, a mode was
provided for amending it; and, as I have already stated, the
present frame of government under which we live consists
of that original, and twelve amendatory articles framed and
adopted since. Those who now insist that Federal control
of slavery in Federal territories violates the Constitution,
point us to the provisions which they suppose it thus violates;
and, as I understand, they all fix upon provisions in these
amendatory articles, and not in the original instrument. The
Supreme Court in the Dred Scott case, plant themselves
upon the fifth amendment, which provides that &#8216;no person
shall be deprived of property without due process of law;&#8217;
while Senator Douglas and his peculiar adherents plant
themselves upon the tenth commandment, providing that
&#8216;the powers not granted by the Constitution are reserved to
the States respectively, and to the people.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, it so happens that these amendments were framed
by the first Congress which sat under the Constitution&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;the
identical Congress which passed the act already mentioned,
enforcing the prohibition of slavery in the north-western<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
territory. Not only was it the same Congress, but they
were the identical, same individual men who, at the same
time within the session, had under consideration, and in progress
toward maturity, these Constitutional amendments, and
this act prohibiting slavery in all the territory the nation
then owned. The Constitutional amendments were introduced
before, and passed after the act enforcing the Ordinance
of &#8217;87; so that during the whole pendency of the act
to enforce the Ordinance, the Constitutional amendments
were also pending.</p>

<p>&#8220;That Congress, consisting in all of seventy-six members,
including sixteen of the framers of the original Constitution,
as before stated, were pre-eminently our fathers who framed
that part of the government under which we live, which is
now claimed as forbidding the Federal Government to control
slavery in the Federal Territories.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it not a little presumptuous in any one at this day, to
affirm that the two things which that Congress deliberately
framed, and carried to maturity at the same time, are absolutely
inconsistent with each other? And does not such
affirmation become impudently absurd when coupled with the
other affirmation, from the same mouth, that those who did
the two things alleged to be inconsistent, understood whether
they were really inconsistent, better than we&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;better than he
who affirms that they are inconsistent.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is surely safe to assume that the &#8216;thirty-nine&#8217; framers
of the original Constitution, and the seventy-six members of
the Congress which framed the amendments thereto, taken
together, do certainly include those who may be fairly called
&#8216;our fathers who framed the government under which we
live.&#8217; And so assuming, I defy any man to show that any
one of them ever, in his whole life, declared that, in his understanding,
any proper division of local from Federal authority,
or any part of the Constitution, forbade the Federal government
to control as to slavery in the Federal territories. I go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
a step further. I defy any one to show that any living man
in the whole world ever did, prior to the beginning of the
present century (and I might almost say prior to the beginning
of the last half of the present century), declare that, in
his understanding, any proper division of local from Federal
authority, or any part of the Constitution, forbade the Federal
government to control as to slavery in the Federal territories.
To those who now so declare, I give, not only &#8216;our fathers
who framed the government under which we live,&#8217; but with
them all other living men within the century in which it was
framed, among whom to search, and they shall not be able to
find the evidence of a single man agreeing with them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, and here, let me guard a little against being misunderstood.
I do not mean to say we are bound to follow
implicitly in whatever our fathers did. To do so would
be to discard all the lights of current experience&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;we reject
all progress&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;all improvement. What I do say is, that if we
would supplant the opinions and policy of our fathers in any
case, we should do so upon evidence so conclusive, and argument
so clear, that even their great authority, fairly considered
and weighed, cannot stand; and most surely not in a case
whereof we ourselves declare they understood the question
better than we.</p>

<p>&#8220;If any man, at this day, sincerely believes that a proper
division of local from Federal authority, or any part of the
Constitution, forbids the Federal government to control as to
slavery in the Federal territories, he is right to say so, and to
enforce his position by all truthful evidence and fair argument
which he can. But he has no right to mislead others, who
have less access to history and less leisure to study it, into the
false belief that &#8216;our fathers, who framed the government
under which we live,&#8217; were of the same opinion, thus substituting
falsehood and deception for truthful evidence and
fair argument. If any man, at this day, sincerely believes
&#8216;our fathers, who framed the government under which we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
live,&#8217; used and applied principles, in other cases, which ought
to have led them to understand that a proper division of local
from Federal authority, or some part of the Constitution, forbids
the Federal government to control as to slavery in the
Federal territories, he is right to say so. But he should, at
the same time, brave the responsibility of declaring that, in
his opinion, he understands their principles better than they
did themselves; and especially should he not shirk that responsibility
by asserting that they &#8216;understood the question
just as well, and even better than we do now.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;But enough. Let all who believe that &#8216;our fathers, who
framed the government under which we live,&#8217; understood this
question just as well, and even better than we do now,&#8217; speak
as they spoke, and act as they acted upon it. This is all
Republicans ask, all Republicans desire, in relation to
slavery. As those fathers marked it, so let it be again marked,
as an evil not to be extended, but to be tolerated and protected
only because of and so far as its actual presence among
us makes that toleration and protection a necessity. Let all
the guaranties those fathers gave it, be, not grudgingly, but
fully and fairly maintained. For this Republicans contend,
and with this, so far as I know or believe, they will be content.</p>

<p>&#8220;And now, if they would listen&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;as I suppose they will
not&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;I would address a few words to the Southern people.</p>

<p>&#8220;I would say to them: You consider yourselves a reasonable
and a just people; and I consider that, in the general
qualities of reason and justice, you are not inferior to any
other people. Still, when you speak of us Republicans, you
do so only to denounce us as reptiles, or, at the best, as no
better than outlaws. You will grant a hearing to pirates or
murderers, but nothing like it to &#8216;Black Republicans.&#8217; In all
your contentions with one another, each of you deems an unconditional
condemnation of &#8216;Black Republicanism&#8217; as the
first thing to be attended to. Indeed, such condemnation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
us seems to be an indispensable prerequisite&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;license, so to
speak&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;among you to be admitted or permitted to speak at
all.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now can you, or not, be prevailed upon to pause and to
consider whether this is quite just to us, or even to yourselves?</p>

<p>&#8220;Bring forward your charges and specifications, and then
be patient long enough to hear us deny or justify.</p>

<p>&#8220;You say we are sectional. We deny it. That makes an
issue; and the burden of proof is upon you. You produce
your proof; and what is it? Why, that our party has no
existence in your section&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;gets no votes in your section.
The fact is substantially true; but does it prove the issue?
If it does, then, in case we should, without change of principle,
begin to get votes in your section, we should thereby
cease to be sectional. You cannot escape this conclusion;
and yet, are you willing to abide by it? If you are, you will
probably soon find that we have ceased to be sectional, for we
shall get votes in your section this very year. You will then
begin to discover, as the truth plainly is, that your proof
does not touch the issue. The fact that we get no votes in
your section is a fact of your making, and not of ours. And
if there be fault in that fact, that fault is primarily yours, and
remains so until you show that we repel you by some wrong
principle or practice. If we do repel you by any wrong
principle or practice, the fault is ours; but this brings us to
where you ought to have started&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;to a discussion of the right
or wrong of our principle. If our principle, put in practice,
would wrong your section for the benefit of ours, or for any
other object, then our principle, and we with it, are sectional,
and are justly opposed and denounced as such. Meet us,
then, on the question of whether our principle, put in practice,
would wrong your section; and so meet it as if it were possible
that something may be said on our side. Do you accept
the challenge? No? Then you really believe that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
principle which our fathers, who framed the government under
which we live, thought so clearly right as to adopt it, and
indorse it again and again upon their official oaths, is, in fact,
so clearly wrong as to demand your condemnation without a
moment&#8217;s consideration.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some of you delight to flaunt in our faces the warning
against sectional parties given by Washington in his Farewell
Address. Less than eight years before Washington gave that
warning, he had, as President of the United States, approved
and signed an act of Congress enforcing the prohibition of
slavery in the Northwestern Territory, which act embodied
the policy of the government upon that subject, up to and at
the very moment he penned that warning; and about one
year after he penned it he wrote Lafayette that he considered
that prohibition a wise measure, expressing, in the same connection,
his hope that we should some time have a confederacy
of free States.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bearing this in mind, and seeing that sectionalism has
since arisen upon this same subject, is that warning a weapon
in your hands against us, or in our hands against you?
Could Washington himself speak, would he cast the blame of
that sectionalism upon us, who sustain his policy, or upon
you, who repudiate it? We respect that warning of Washington,
and we commend it to you, together with his example
pointing to the right application of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you say you are conservative&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;eminently conservative&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;while
we are revolutionary, destructive, or something
of the sort. What is conservatism? Is it not adherence to
the old and tried against the new and untried? We stick to,
contend for, the identical old policy on the point in controversy
which was adopted by our fathers who framed the
government under which we live; while you, with one
accord, reject, and scout, and spit upon that old policy, and
insist upon substituting something new. True, you disagree
among yourselves as to what that substitute shall be. You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
have considerable variety of new propositions and plans, but
you are unanimous in rejecting and denouncing the old policy
of the fathers. Some of you are for reviving the foreign
slave-trade; some for a Congressional Slave-Code for the
Territories; some for Congress forbidding the Territories to
prohibit slavery within their limits; some for maintaining
slavery in the Territories through the Judiciary; some for
the &#8216;gur-reat pur-rinciple&#8217; that, &#8216;if one man would enslave
another, no third man should object,&#8217; fantastically called
&#8216;Popular Sovereignty;&#8217; but never a man among you in favor
of Federal prohibition of slavery in Federal Territories,
according to the practice of our fathers who framed the
government under which we live. Not one of all your various
plans can show a precedent or an advocate in the century
within which our government originated. Consider, then,
whether your claim of conservatism for yourselves, and your
charge of destructiveness against us, are based on the most
clear and stable foundations.</p>

<p>&#8220;Again, you say we have made the slavery question more
prominent than it formerly was. We deny it. We admit
that it is more prominent, but we deny that we made it so.
It was not we, but you, who discarded the old policy of the
fathers. We resisted, and still resist, your innovation; and
thence comes the greater prominence of the question. Would
you have that question reduced to its former proportions?
Go back to that old policy. What has been will be again,
under the same conditions. If you would have the peace of
the old times, re-adopt the precepts and policy of the old
times.</p>

<p>&#8220;You charge that we stir up insurrections among your
slaves. We deny it. And what is your proof? Harper&#8217;s
Ferry! John Brown! John Brown was no Republican;
and you have failed to implicate a single Republican in his
Harper&#8217;s Ferry enterprise. If any member of our party is
guilty in that matter, you know it, or you do not know it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
If you do know it, you are inexcusable to not designate the
man, and prove the fact. If you do not know it, you are
inexcusable to assert it, and especially to persist in the assertion
after you have tried and failed to make the proof. You
need not be told that persisting in a charge which one does
not know to be true is simply malicious slander.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some of you admit that no Republican designedly aided
or encouraged the Harper&#8217;s Ferry affair; but still insist that
our doctrines and declarations necessarily lead to such results.
We do not believe it. We know we hold to no doctrine, and
make no declarations which were not held to and made by
our fathers who framed the government under which we live.
You never deal fairly by us in relation to this affair. When
it occurred, some important State elections were near at
hand, and you were in evident glee with the belief that, by
charging the blame upon us, you could get an advantage of
us in those elections. The elections came, and your expectations
were not quite fulfilled. Every Republican man knew
that, as to himself, at least, your charge was a slander, and
he was not much inclined by it to cast his vote in your favor.
Republican doctrines and declarations are accompanied with
a continual protest against any interference whatever with
your slaves, or with you about your slaves. Surely, this
does not encourage them to revolt. True, we do, in common
with our fathers, who framed the government under which
we live, declare our belief that slavery is wrong; but the
slaves do not hear us declare even this. For any thing we
say or do, the slaves would scarcely know there is a Republican
party. I believe they would not, in fact, generally know
it but for your misrepresentations of us in their hearing. In
your political contest among yourselves, each faction charges
the other with sympathy with Black Republicanism; and
then, to give point to the charge, defines Black Republicanism
to simply be insurrection, blood and thunder among the
slaves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
&#8220;Slave insurrections are no more common now than they
were before the Republican party was organized. What induced
the Southampton insurrection, twenty-eight years ago,
in which, at least, three times as many lives were lost as at
Harper&#8217;s Ferry? You can scarcely stretch your very elastic
fancy to the conclusion that Southampton was got up by
Black Republicanism. In the present state of things in the
United States, I do not think a general, or even a very extensive
slave insurrection, is possible. The indispensable concert
of action cannot be attained. The slaves have no means
of rapid communication; nor can incendiary free men, black
or white, supply it. The explosive materials are everywhere
in parcels; but there neither are, nor can be supplied, the
indispensable connecting trains.</p>

<p>&#8220;Much is said by southern people about the affection of
slaves for their masters and mistresses; and a part of it, at
least, is true. A plot for an uprising could scarcely be devised
and communicated to twenty individuals before some
one of them, to save the life of a favorite master or mistress,
would divulge it. This is the rule; and the slave revolution
in Hayti was not an exception to it, but a case occurring
under peculiar circumstances. The gunpowder plot of British
history, though not connected with the slaves, was more in
point. In that case, only about twenty were admitted to the
secret; and yet one of them, in his anxiety to save a friend,
betrayed the plot to that friend, and, by consequence, averted
the calamity. Occasional poisoning from the kitchen, and
open or stealthy assassinations in the field, and local revolts
extending to a score or so, will continue to occur as the natural
results of slavery; but no general insurrection of slaves,
as I think, can happen in this country for a long time. Whoever
much fears, or much hopes, for such an event, will be
alike disappointed.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the language of Mr. Jefferson, uttered many years ago,
&#8216;It is still in our power to direct the process of emancipation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
and deportation, peaceably, and in such slow degrees, as that
the evil will wear off insensibly; and their places be, <i>pari
passu</i>, filled up by free white laborers. If, on the contrary,
it is left to force itself on, human nature must shudder at the
prospect held up.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Jefferson did not mean to say, nor do I, that the
power of emancipation is in the Federal Government. He
spoke of Virginia; and, as to the power of emancipation, I
speak of the slaveholding States only.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Federal Government, however, as we insist, has the
power of restraining the extension of the institution&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;the power
to insure that a slave insurrection shall never occur on any
American soil which is now free from slavery.</p>

<p>&#8220;John Brown&#8217;s effort was peculiar. It was not a slave
insurrection. It was an attempt by white men to get up a
revolt among slaves, in which the slaves refused to participate.
In fact, it was so absurd that the slaves, with all their
ignorance, saw plainly enough it could not succeed. That
affair, in its philosophy, corresponds with the many attempts,
related in history, at the assassination of kings and emperors.
An enthusiast broods over the oppression of a people till he
fancies himself commissioned by Heaven to liberate them.
He ventures the attempt, which ends in little else than in his
own execution. Orsini&#8217;s attempt on Louis Napoleon, and
John Brown&#8217;s attempt at Harper&#8217;s Ferry were, in their philosophy,
precisely the same. The eagerness to cast blame
on old England in the one case, and on New England in the
other, does not disprove the sameness of the two things.</p>

<p>&#8220;And how much would it avail you, if you could, by the
use of John Brown, Helper&#8217;s book, and the like, break up the
Republican organization? Human action can be modified to
some extent, but human nature cannot be changed. There
is a judgment and a feeling against slavery in this nation,
which cast at least a million and a half of votes. You cannot
destroy that judgment and feeling&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;that sentiment&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
breaking up the political organization which rallies around
it. You can scarcely scatter and disperse an army which
has been formed into order in the face of your heaviest fire;
but if you could, how much would you gain by forcing the
sentiment which created it out of the peaceful channel of the
ballot-box, into some other channel? What would that other
channel probably be? Would the number of John Browns
be lessened or enlarged by the operation?</p>

<p>&#8220;But you will break up the Union rather than submit to a
denial of your Constitutional rights.</p>

<p>&#8220;That has a somewhat reckless sound; but it would be
palliated, if not fully justified, were we proposing by the mere
force of numbers, to deprive you of some right plainly written
down in the Constitution. But we are proposing no such thing.</p>

<p>&#8220;When you make these declarations, you have a specific
and well-understood allusion to an assumed Constitutional
right of yours, to take slaves into the federal territories, and
hold them there as property, but no such right is specifically
written in the Constitution. That instrument is literally silent
about any such right. We, on the contrary, deny that such
a right has any existence in the Constitution, even by implication.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your purpose, then, plainly stated, is, that you will
destroy the Government, unless you be allowed to construe
and enforce the Constitution as you please, on all points in
dispute between you and us. You will rule or ruin in all
events.</p>

<p>&#8220;This, plainly stated, is your language to us. Perhaps
you will say the Supreme Court has decided the disputed
Constitutional question in your favor. Not quite so. But
waiving the lawyer&#8217;s distinction between dictum and decision,
the Courts have decided the question for you in a sort of
way. The Courts have substantially said, it is your Constitutional
right to take slaves into the Federal Territories, and
to hold them there as property.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
&#8220;When I say the decision was made in a sort of way, I
mean it was made in a divided Court by a bare majority of
the Judges, and they not quite agreeing with one another in
the reasons for making it; that it is so made as that its
avowed supporters disagree with one another about its meaning,
and that it was mainly based upon a mistaken statement
of fact&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;the statement in the opinion that &#8216;the right of
property in a slave is distinctly and expressly affirmed in the
Constitution.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;An inspection of the Constitution will show that the right
of property in a slave is not distinctly and expressly affirmed
in it. Bear in mind the Judges do not pledge their judicial
opinion that such right is impliedly affirmed in the Constitution;
but they pledge their veracity that it is distinctly and
expressly affirmed there&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;&#8216;distinctly&#8217; that is, not mingled
with anything else&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;&#8216;expressly&#8217; that is, in words meaning
just that, without the aid of any inference, and susceptible of
no other meaning.</p>

<p>&#8220;If they had only pledged their judicial opinion that such
right is affirmed in the instrument by implication, it would
be open to others to show that neither the word &#8216;slave&#8217; nor
&#8216;slavery&#8217; is to be found in the Constitution, nor the word
&#8216;property&#8217; even, in any connection with language alluding to
the things slave, or slavery, and that wherever in that instrument
the slave is alluded to, he is called a &#8216;person;&#8217; and
wherever his master&#8217;s legal right in relation to him is alluded
to, it is spoken of as &#8216;service or labor due,&#8217; as a &#8216;debt&#8217; payable
in service or labor. Also, it would be open to show, by
contemporaneous history, that this mode of alluding to slaves
and slavery, instead of speaking of them, was employed on
purpose to exclude from the Constitution the idea that there
could be property in man.</p>

<p>&#8220;To show all this is easy and certain.</p>

<p>&#8220;When this obvious mistake of the Judges shall be brought
to their notice, is it not reasonable to expect that they will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
withdraw the mistaken statement, and reconsider the conclusion
based upon it?</p>

<p>&#8220;And then it is to be remembered that &#8216;our fathers, who
framed the Government under which we live&#8217;&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;the men who
made the Constitution&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;decided this same Constitutional
question in our favor, long ago&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;decided it without a division
among themselves, when making the decision; without division
among themselves about the meaning of it after it was
made, and so far as any evidence is left, without basing it
upon any mistaken statement of facts.</p>

<p>&#8220;Under all these circumstances, do you really feel yourselves
justified to break up this Government, unless such a
court decision as yours is shall be at once submitted to, as a
conclusive and final rule of political action.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you will not abide the election of a Republican President.
In that supposed event, you say, you will destroy the
Union; and then, you say, the great crime of having destroyed
it will be upon us!</p>

<p>&#8220;That is cool. A highwayman holds a pistol to my ear,
and mutters through his teeth, &#8216;stand and deliver, or I shall
kill you, and then you will be a murderer!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;To be sure, what the robber demanded of me&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;my money&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;was
my own; and I had a clear right to keep it; but it
was no more my own than my vote is my own; and threat
of death to me, to extort my money, and threat of destruction
to the Union, to extort my vote, can scarcely be distinguished
in principle.</p>

<p>&#8220;A few words now to Republicans. It is exceedingly
desirable that all parts of this great Confederacy shall be at
peace, and in harmony, one with another. Let us Republicans
do our part to have it so. Even though much provoked,
let us do nothing through passion and ill-temper. Even
though the southern people will not so much as listen
to us, let us calmly consider their demands, and yield to them
if, in our deliberate view of our duty, we possibly can.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
Judging by all they say and do, and by the subject and
nature of their controversy with us, let us determine, if we
can, what will satisfy them?</p>

<p>&#8220;Will they be satisfied if the Territories be unconditionally
surrendered to them? We know they will not. In all their
present complaints against us, the Territories are scarcely
mentioned. Invasions and insurrections are the rage now.
Will it satisfy them if, in the future, we have nothing to do
with invasions and insurrections? We know it will not.
We so know because we know we never had any thing to do
with invasions and insurrections; and yet this total abstaining
does not exempt us from the charge and the denunciation.</p>

<p>&#8220;The question recurs, what will satisfy them? Simply
this: We must not only let them alone, but we must, somehow,
convince them that we do let them alone. This we
know by experience, is no easy task. We have been so trying
to convince them from the very beginning of our organization,
but with no success. In all our platforms and speeches we
have constantly protested our purpose to let them alone; but
this has had no tendency to convince them. Alike unavailing
to convince them is the fact that they have never detected a
man of us in any attempt to disturb them.</p>

<p>&#8220;These natural, and apparently adequate means all failing,
what will convince them? This, and this only: cease to call
slavery <i>wrong</i>, and join them in calling it <i>right</i>. And this
must be done thoroughly&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;done in <i>acts</i> as well as in <i>words</i>.
Silence will not be tolerated&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;we must place ourselves
avowedly with them. Douglas&#8217;s new sedition law must be
enacted and enforced, suppressing all declarations that
slavery is wrong, whether made in politics, in presses, in
pulpits, or in private. We must arrest and return their fugitive
slaves with greedy pleasure. We must pull down our
Free-State Constitutions. The whole atmosphere must be
disinfected from all taint of opposition to slavery, before they
will cease to believe that all their troubles proceed from us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
&#8220;I am quite aware they do not state their case precisely
in this way. Most of them would probably say to us, &#8216;Let
us alone, do nothing to us, and say what you please about
slavery.&#8217; But we do let them alone&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;have never disturbed
them&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;so that, after all, it is what we say which dissatisfies
them. They will continue to accuse us of doing, until we
cease saying.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am also aware they have not, as yet, in terms, demanded
the overthrow of our Free-State Constitutions. Yet
those Constitutions declare the wrong of slavery, with more
solemn emphasis than do all other sayings against it; and
when all these other sayings shall have been silenced, the
overthrow of these Constitutions will be demanded, and
nothing be left to resist the demand. It is nothing to the
contrary, that they do not demand the whole of this just now.
Demanding what they do, and for the reason they do, they
can voluntarily stop nowhere short of this consummation.
Holding, as they do, that slavery is morally right, and socially
elevating, they cannot cease to demand a full national recognition
of it, as a legal right and a social blessing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor can we justifiably withhold this, on any ground save
our conviction that slavery is wrong. If slavery is right, all
words, acts, laws, and constitutions against it, are themselves
wrong, and should be silenced and swept away. If it is
right, we cannot justly object to its nationality&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;its universality;
if it is wrong, they cannot justly insist upon its
extension&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;its enlargement. All they ask, we could readily
grant, if we thought slavery right; all we ask, they could
as readily grant, if they thought it wrong. Their thinking
it right, and our thinking it wrong, is the precise fact upon
which depends the whole controversy. Thinking it right, as
they do, they are not to blame for desiring its full recognition,
as being right; but, thinking it wrong, as we do, can we
yield to them? Can we cast our votes with their view, and
against our own? In view of our moral, social, and political
responsibilities, can we do this?</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;Wrong as we think slavery is, we can yet afford to let it
alone where it is, because that much is due to the necessity
arising from its actual presence in the nation; but can we,
while our votes will prevent it, allow it to spread into the
National Territories, and to overrun us here in these Free
States?</p>

<p>&#8220;If our sense of duty forbids this, then let us stand by our
duty, fearlessly and effectively. Let us be diverted by none
of those sophistical contrivances wherewith we are so industriously
plied and belabored&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;contrivances such as groping
for some middle ground between the right and the wrong,
vain as the search for a man who should be neither a living
man nor a dead man&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;such as a policy of &#8216;dont care&#8217; on a
question about which all true men do care&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;such as Union
appeals beseeching true Union men to yield to Disunionists,
reversing the Divine rule, and calling, not the sinners, but
the righteous to repentance&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;such as invocations to Washington,
imploring men to unsay what Washington said, and undo
what Washington did.</p>

<p>&#8220;Neither let us be slandered from our duty by false accusations
against us, not frightened from it by menaces of
destruction to the Government, nor of dungeons to ourselves.
Let us have faith that right makes might, and in that faith,
let us, to the end, dare to do our duty as we understand it.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>It was during this visit to New York that the following
incident occurred, as related by a teacher in the Five-Points
House of Industry, in that city:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;Our Sunday-school in the Five-Points was assembled,
one Sabbath morning, a few months since, when I noticed a
tall and remarkable-looking man enter the room and take a
seat among us. He listened with fixed attention to our exercises,
and his countenance manifested such genuine interest
that I approached him and suggested that he might be willing
to say something to the children. He accepted the invitation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
with evident pleasure, and, coming forward, began a
simple address, which at once fascinated every little hearer,
and hushed the room into silence. His language was
strikingly beautiful, and his tones musical with intensest
feeling. The little faces around would droop into sad conviction
as he uttered sentences of warning, and would brighten
into sunshine as he spoke cheerful words of promise. Once
or twice he attempted to close his remarks, but the imperative
shout of &#8216;Go on!&#8217; &#8216;Oh, do go on!&#8217; would compel him to resume.
As I looked upon the gaunt and sinewy frame of the
stranger, and marked his powerful head and determined
features, now touched into softness by the impressions of the
moment, I felt an irrepressible curiosity to learn something
more about him, and when he was quietly leaving the room
I begged to know his name. He courteously replied, &#8216;It is
Abra&#8217;m Lincoln, from Illinois!&#8217;&#8221;</p></blockquote>

Rebels.</p></blockquote>

<p>On the 16th of May, 1860, the Republican National Convention
met at Chicago, to present candidates for the Presidency
and Vice-Presidency. The Democratic Convention
had previously adjourned, after a stormy session of some two
weeks, at which it was apparent that, if Mr. Douglas&#8217;s friends
persisted in placing him in nomination, another candidate
would be presented by the wing opposed to his peculiar views<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
on the slavery question, and the great party would thus be
disrupted. Another convention, claiming to represent, in a
peculiarly individual manner, the party in favor of the Constitution
and the Union, had met at Baltimore and put in
nomination John Bell, of Tennessee, and Edward Everett, of
Massachusetts.</p>

<p>The aspect seemed favorable for the election of the Republican
candidates, and that convention, on the morning of the
18th of May&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;one day having been spent in organizing and
another in the adoption of a platform of principles&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;amid the
intense excitement of the twelve thousand people inside of
the &#8220;Wigwam&#8221; (as the building was styled in which the body
was in session), voted to proceed at once to ballot for a candidate
for President of the United States.</p>

<p>Seven names were formally presented in the following order:
William H. Seward, of New York; Abraham Lincoln, of Illinois;
William L. Dayton, of New Jersey; Simon Cameron,
of Pennsylvania; Salmon P. Chase, of Ohio; Edward Bates,
of Missouri; and John McLean, of Ohio.</p>

<p>On the first ballot Mr. Seward received 173 votes, Mr.
Lincoln 102, Mr. Cameron 50, Mr. Chase 49, Mr. Bates 48,
Mr. Dayton 14, Mr. McLean 12, and there were 16 votes
scattered among candidates not put in nomination. For a
choice, 233 votes were required.</p>

<p>On the second ballot (Mr. Cameron&#8217;s name having been
withdrawn) the vote for the several candidates was as follows:
Mr. Seward 184, Mr. Lincoln 181, Mr. Chase 42, Mr. Bates
35, Mr. Dayton 10, Mr. McLean 8, scattering 4.</p>

<p>The third ballot was immediately taken, and, when the call
of the roll was ended, the footings were as follows: For Mr.
Lincoln 231, Mr. Seward 180, Mr. Chase 24, Mr. Bates. 22,
all others 7. Immediately before the result was announced,
four Ohio delegates changed their votes to Mr. Lincoln, giving
him a majority.</p>

<p>The scene which followed&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;the wild, almost delirious outburst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
of applause within and without the building, the congratulations,
the hand-shakings, the various manifestations of
joy, continued with scarcely any interruption for some three-quarters
of an hour&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;was probably never before witnessed
in a popular assembly.</p>

<p>The nomination having been made unanimous, the ticket
was completed by the selection of Senator Hannibal Hamlin,
of Maine, as Vice-President.</p>

<p>The country then felt that the right man had for once
been put in the right place. As a man of the people, in cordial
sympathy with the masses, Mr. Lincoln enjoyed the
unhesitating confidence of the sincere friends of free labor,
regardless of party distinctions. His tried integrity and incorruptible
honesty gave promise of a return to the better
days of the republic. Every man, laboring for the advancement
of his fellow, knew that in him humanity, irrespective
of race or condition, had a tried and trusty friend.</p>

<p>The committee, appointed to apprise him of his nomination,
found him at his home, in Springfield, a frame two-storied
house, apparently about thirty-five or forty feet square, standing
at the corner of two streets. After entering the parlor,
which was very plainly furnished, though in good taste, a
brief address was made by the chairman of the convention,
upon the utterance of the first sentence of which a smile played
round Mr. Lincoln&#8217;s large, firm-set mouth, his eyes lit up,
and his face conveyed to those who then for the first time
met him, an impression of that sincere, loving nature which
those who had known him long and well had learned in some
measure to comprehend and revere.</p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>In response to this address, Mr. Lincoln said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen of the Committee</span>: I
tender to you, and through you to the Republican National
Convention, and all the people represented in it, my profoundest
thanks for the high honor done me, which you now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>formally announce. Deeply, and even painfully sensible of
the great responsibility which is inseparable from this high
honor&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;a responsibility which I could almost wish had fallen
upon some one of the far more eminent men and experienced
statesmen whose distinguished names were before the Convention,
I shall, by your leave, consider more fully the resolutions
of the Convention, denominated the platform, and without
unnecessary and unreasonable delay, respond to you, Mr.
Chairman, in writing, not doubting that the platform will be
found satisfactory, and the nomination gratefully accepted.
And now I will not longer defer the pleasure of taking you,
and each of you, by the hand.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>In reply to the formal letter of the President of the Convention,
apprising him of the nomination, Mr. Lincoln addressed
the following:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sigright">

&#8220;<i>Springfield, Illinois</i>, May 23d, 1860.</p>

<p class="hangleft">&#8220;<span class="smcap">Hon. George Ashman</span>, <i>President of the Republican National
Convention</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Sir</span>: I accept the nomination tendered me by the Convention
over which you presided, and of which I am formally
apprised in the letter of yourself and others, acting as a Committee
of the Convention for that purpose.</p>

<p>&#8220;The declaration of principles and sentiments, which accompanies
your letter, meets my approval; and it shall be
my care not to violate, or disregard it, in any part.</p>

<p>&#8220;Imploring the assistance of Divine Providence, and with
due regard to the views and feelings of all who were represented
in the Convention; to the rights of all the States and
Territories, and people of the nation; to the inviolability of
the Constitution, and the perpetual union, harmony and prosperity
of all, I am most happy to co-operate for the practical
success of the principles declared by the Convention,</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="l2">&#8220;Your obliged friend and fellow-citizen,</span><br />
&#8220;<span class="smcap">Abraham Lincoln</span>.&#8221;<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
The breach in the Democratic party, threatened at Charleston,
was subsequently effected by the nomination of Stephen
A. Douglas and Herschel V. Johnson, of Georgia, by one
wing, and of John C. Breckinridge, of Kentucky, and Joseph
Lane, of Oregon, by the other.</p>

<p>Although the election of Mr. Lincoln was, under the circumstances,
almost a foregone conclusion, yet the canvass
which ensued was acrimonious and vindictive in the extreme,
the choicest selections from the rank Billingsgate vocabularies
being lavished on the head of Mr. Lincoln and his supporters.</p>

<p>On the 6th of November, 1860, Mr. Lincoln received
1,866,452 votes, securing the electoral votes of the States of
Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode
Island, Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana,
Illinois, Michigan, Iowa, Wisconsin, Minnesota, California,
Oregon, and four votes of New Jersey, 180 in all; Douglas,
1,375,157 votes, and the electoral votes of Missouri, and three
of New Jersey, 12 in all; Breckinridge, 847,953, and the
votes of Maryland, Delaware, North Carolina, South Carolina,
Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, Arkansas,
and Texas, 72 in all; and Bell, 590,631, and the votes of
Virginia, Kentucky, and Tennessee, 39 in all.</p>

<p>And now was to be tested whether words were to ripen
into deeds&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;whether threats would be reduced to practice&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;whether,
indeed, there were madness enough in any State or
States to attempt the life of the republic. Unfortunately, a
short space of time elapsed before all doubts were at an end.
Men were to be found&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;not confined to a single State, but
representatives of nearly, if not quite all&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;not to be counted
by scores or hundreds even, but by thousands, and soon by
tens of thousands&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;ready to lay their unhallowed hands upon
the Union, the ark of our nation&#8217;s glory and strength.</p>

<p>To South Carolina belongs the bold, bad eminence of
taking the initiation in this conspiracy against the interests
of humanity. While this State&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;doomed forever after to an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
ignominy from which centuries of unquestioned loyalty cannot
free her&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;was taking the requisite steps toward secession,
the then President, James Buchanan, with a pusillanimity&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;to
use no stronger term&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;which modern history certainly has
never paralleled, in his annual message, after having urged
the unconstitutionality of the proceeding, gave explicit notification
that he had no constitutional power to prevent the
proposed measures being hastened to successful completion.
Neither, though appealed to, at a still earlier day, by the
veteran chief of the army, to occupy and hold the United
States on the Southern coast, could he find any warrant for
protecting and defending the national property.</p>

<p>Surely nothing more could the conspirators have desired.
On the 20th of December, 1860, South Carolina claims to
secede&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;Government forts and arsenals are seized, and
placed under the protection of the flag of the State. Georgia&#8217;s
Governor lays hand on the United States forts on the coast
of that State, on the 3d of January, 1861; as did the Executive
of Alabama on the following day.</p>

<p>Events of a startling nature follow in rapid succession.
On the 9th of January, hostile shots are fired upon a vessel
bringing tardy reinforcements to Fort Sumter, and Mississippi
assumes to put herself out of the Union. Alabama, Florida,
and Georgia are not laggard; nor are Texas and Louisiana
found wanting. Cabinet officers from the slave States either
resigned, after having aided the fell work to their utmost, or
remained only to hasten its consummation. A new constitution,
&#8220;temporary&#8221; in its nature, was declared by delegates
from the seven States then in rebellion, and a President and
Vice-President appointed.</p>

<p>Meanwhile a convention, composed of delegates from most
of the Free States, and from all the border Slave States, was
striving, at Washington, to heal existing difficulties by compromise.
Of its members some were acting in good faith,
others were using it as a breakwater for the States already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
in overt rebellion. A series of resolutions, however, aiming
at peace on the basis of a preserved Union was agreed to by
a majority, and the body adjourned on the 1st of March.</p>

<p>On the 11th of February, moreover, the National House of
Representatives unanimously adopted a resolution&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;shortly
afterward concurred in by the Senate&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;providing for an
amendment to the Constitution, forever prohibiting any Congressional
legislation interfering with slavery in any State.
Some there were, too, who were willing to concede almost
every thing and surrender the long mooted question of slavery
in the territories by the adoption of the so-called Crittenden
resolutions, which were killed in cold blood by Southern
Senators.</p>

<p>But no concession, short of actual national degradation,
would satisfy the recusants. Jefferson Davis, the head of the
&#8220;Confederacy,&#8221; on placing himself at the head of the rebellion,
at Montgomery, Alabama, February 18th, modestly defined
the position of himself and his co-conspirators thus:</p>

<p>&#8220;If a just perception of neutral interest shall permit us
peaceably to pursue our separate political career, my most
earnest desire will have been fulfilled. But if this be denied
us, and the integrity of our territory and jurisdiction be
assailed, it will but remain for us with firm resolve to appeal
to arms, and invoke the blessing of Providence on a just
cause.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was at once clinched by a recommendation that &#8220;a
well-instructed, disciplined army, more numerous than would
usually be required, on a peace establishment,&#8221; should be at
once organized and put in training for the emergency.</p>

anxiety&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;the hearts of many failing them through fear&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;when,
on the morning of the 11th of February, 1861, the
President elect with his family, bade adieu to that prairie
home which, alas! he was never again to see.</p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>The large throng which had assembled at the railway
station on the occasion of his departure, he addressed in
words replete with the pathos of every true manly nature:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">My Friends</span>:&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;No one, not in my position, can appreciate
the sadness I feel at this parting. To this people I owe
all that I am. Here I have lived more than a quarter of a
century; here my children were born, and here one of them
lies buried. I know not how soon I shall see you again. A
duty devolves upon me which is, perhaps, greater than that
which has devolved upon any other man since the days of
Washington. He never could have succeeded except for the
aid of Divine Providence, upon which he at all times relied.
I feel that I cannot succeed without the same Divine aid
which sustained him; and in the same Almighty being I
place my reliance for support, and I hope you, my friends, will
all pray that I may receive that Divine assistance, without
which I can not succeed, but with which success is certain.
Again, I bid you all an affectionate farewell.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
Along the route, multitudes gathered at the stations to
greet him. At Toledo, Ohio, in reply to repeated calls, he
appeared on the platform of the car and said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;I am leaving you on an errand of national importance,
attended, as you are aware, with considerable difficulties.
Let us believe, as some poet has expressed it, &#8216;Behind the
cloud the sun is shining still.&#8217; I bid you an affectionate farewell.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>At Indianapolis, on the evening of the same day, in reply
to an official address of welcome, he gave the first direct
public intimation of his views concerning the absorbing
topics of the day, in which homely sense and cheerful
pleasantry were blended with a skill beyond the power of
mere art:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Fellow Citizens of the State of Indiana</span>:&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;I am here
to thank you for this magnificent welcome, and still more for
the very generous support given by your State to that
political cause, which, I think, is the true and just cause of
the whole country, and the whole world. Solomon says,
&#8216;there is a time to keep silence;&#8217; and when men wrangle by
the mouth, with no certainty that they mean the same thing
while using the same words, it perhaps were as well if they
would keep silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;The words &#8216;coercion&#8217; and &#8216;invasion&#8217; are much used in
these days, and often with some temper and hot blood. Let
us make sure, if we can, that we do not misunderstand the
meaning of those who use them. Let us get the exact definitions
of these words, not from dictionaries, but from the
men themselves, who certainly deprecate the things they
would represent by the use of the words.</p>

<p>&#8220;What, then, is coercion? What is invasion? Would
the marching of an army into South Carolina, without
the consent of her people, and with hostile intent toward
them, be invasion? I certainly think it would, and it would
be coercion also, if the South Carolinians were forced to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
submit. But if the United States should merely hold and
retake its own forts and other property, and collect the duties
on foreign importations, or even withhold the mails from
places where they were habitually violated, would any or all
of these things be invasion or coercion? Do our professed
lovers of the Union, who spitefully resolve that they will
resist coercion and invasion, understand that such things as
these, on the part of the United States, would be coercion or
invasion of a State? If so, their idea of means to preserve
the object of their great affection would seem to be exceedingly
thin and airy. If sick, the little pills of the homeopathist
would be much too large for it to swallow. In their view,
the Union, as a family relation, would seem to be no regular
marriage, but rather a sort of &#8216;free-love&#8217; arrangement, to be
maintained on passional attraction.</p>

<p>&#8220;By the way, in what consists the special sacredness of a
State? I speak not of the position assigned to a State in the
Union by the Constitution, for that is a bond we all recognize.
That position, however, a State cannot carry out of
the Union with it. I speak of that assumed primary right
of a State to rule all which is less than itself, and to ruin all
which is larger than itself. If a State and a County,
in a given case, should be equal in number of inhabitants, in
what, as a matter of principle, is the State better than
the County? Would an exchange of name be an exchange
of rights? Upon what principle, upon what rightful principle,
may a State, being no more than one-fiftieth part of the
nation in soil and population, break up the nation, and then
coerce a proportionally large sub-division of itself in the
most arbitrary way? What mysterious right to play tyrant
is conferred on a district or country with its people, by
merely calling it a State? Fellow citizens, I am not asserting
any thing. I am merely asking questions for you to
consider. And now allow me to bid you farewell.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Proceeding to Cincinnati, he received a most enthusiastic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
welcome. Having been addressed by the mayor of the city,
and escorted by a civic and military procession to the Burnet
House, he addressed the assemblage in these words:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Fellow-Citizens</span>: I have spoken but once before this in
Cincinnati. That was a year previous to the late Presidential
election. On that occasion in a playful manner, but with
sincere words, I addressed much of what I said to the Kentuckians.
I gave my opinion that we, as Republicans, would
ultimately beat them as Democrats, but that they could postpone
the result longer by nominating Senator Douglas for the
Presidency than they could in any other way. They did not,
in any true sense of the word, nominate Mr. Douglas, and the
result has come certainly as soon as ever I expected.</p>

<p>&#8220;I also told them how I expected they would be treated
after they should have been beaten, and now wish to call
their attention to what I then said:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;When we do, as we say we will, beat you, you perhaps
want to know what we will do with you. I will tell you&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;as
far as I am authorized to speak for the opposition&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;what
we mean to do with you. We mean to treat you as near as
we possibly can, as Washington, Jefferson, and Madison
treated you. We mean to leave you alone, and in no way to
interfere with your institutions; to abide by all and every
compromise of the Constitution. In a word, coming back to
the original proposition, to treat you, as far as degenerate
men&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;if we have degenerated&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;may, according to the example
of those noble fathers, Washington, Jefferson, and Madison.
We mean to remember that you are as good as we;
that there is no difference between us other than the difference
of circumstances. We mean to recognize and bear in mind
always that you have as good hearts in your bosoms as other
people, or as we claim to have, and to treat you accordingly.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fellow-citizens of Kentucky, friends, brethren: May I
call you such? In my new position I see no occasion and
feel no inclination to retract a word of this. If it shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
not be made good be assured that the fault shall not be
mine.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>On the next morning he left Cincinnati, and arrived at
Columbus, where he was received with every demonstration
of enthusiasm. He visited the Governor in the Executive
Chamber, and was subsequently introduced to the members
of the Legislature in joint session, when he was formally
welcomed by the Lieutenant-Governor, to whom Mr. Lincoln
responded in these words:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;It is true, as has been said by the President of the Senate,
that very great responsibility rests upon me in the position
to which the votes of the American people have called me.
I am deeply sensible of that weighty responsibility. I cannot
but know, what you all know, that without a name&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;perhaps
without a reason why I should have a name&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;there
has fallen upon me a task such as did not rest upon the
Father of his Country. And so feeling, I cannot but turn
and look for the support without which it will be impossible
for me to perform that great task. I turn, then, and look to
the American people, and to that God who has never forsaken
them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Allusion has been made to the interest felt in relation to
the policy of the new Administration. In this, I have received
from some a degree of credit for having kept silence,
from others some depreciation. I still think I was right. In
the varying and repeatedly shifting scenes of the present,
without a precedent which could enable me to judge for the
past, it has seemed fitting, that before speaking upon the
difficulties of the country I should have gained a view of the
whole field. To be sure, after all, I would be at liberty to
modify and change the course of policy as future events
might make a change necessary.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have not maintained silence from any want of real anxiety.
It is a good thing that there is no more than anxiety,
for there is nothing going wrong. It is a consoling circumstance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
that when we look out there is nothing that really
hurts anybody. We entertain different views upon political
questions, but nobody is suffering any thing. This is a most
consoling circumstance, and from it I judge that all we want
is time and patience, and a reliance on that God who has
never forsaken this people.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>On the 14th of February, Mr. Lincoln proceeded to Pittsburgh.
At Steubenville, on the route, in reply to an address,
he said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;I fear the great confidence placed in my ability is unfounded.
Indeed, I am sure it is. Encompassed by vast
difficulties, as I am, nothing shall be wanted on my part, if
sustained by the American people and God. I believe the
devotion to the Constitution is equally great on both sides of
the river. It is only the different understanding of that instrument
that causes difficulties. The only dispute is &#8216;What
are their rights?&#8217; If the majority should not rule who should
be the judge? Where is such a judge to be found? We
should all be bound by the majority of the American people&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;if
not, then the minority must control. Would that be
right? Would it be just or generous? Assuredly not.&#8221; He
reiterated, the majority should rule. If he adopted a wrong
policy, then the opportunity to condemn him would occur in
four years&#8217; time. &#8220;Then I can be turned out and a better
man with better views put in my place.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>The next morning he left for Cleveland, but before his departure
he made an address to the people of Pittsburgh, in
which he said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;In every short address I have made to the people, and in
every crowd through which I have passed of late, some allusion
has been made to the present distracted condition of
the country. It is naturally expected that I should say
something upon this subject, but to touch upon it at all would
involve an elaborate discussion of a great many questions
and circumstances, would require more time than I can at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
present command, and would perhaps unnecessarily commit
me upon matters which have not yet fully developed themselves.</p>

<p>&#8220;The condition of the country, fellow-citizens, is an extraordinary
one, and fills the mind of every patriot with
anxiety and solicitude. My intention is to give this subject
all the consideration which I possibly can before I speak fully
and definitely in regard to it, so that, when I do speak, I
may be as nearly right as possible. And when I do speak,
fellow-citizens, I hope to say nothing in opposition to the
spirit of the Constitution, contrary to the integrity of the
Union, or which will in any way prove inimical to the liberties
of the people or to the peace of the whole country.
And, furthermore, when the time arrives for me to speak on
this great subject, I hope to say nothing which will disappoint
the reasonable expectations of any man, or disappoint
the people generally throughout the country, especially if
their expectations have been based upon any thing which I
may have heretofore said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Notwithstanding the troubles across the river [the
speaker, smiling, pointed southwardly to the Monongahela
river], there is really no crisis springing from any thing in
the Government itself. In plain words, there is really no
crisis except an artificial one. What is there now to warrant
the condition of affairs presented by our friends &#8216;over the
river?&#8217; Take even their own view of the questions involved,
and there is nothing to justify the course which they are pursuing.
I repeat it, then, there is no crisis, except such a one
as may be gotten up at any time by turbulent men, aided by
designing politicians. My advice, then, under such circumstances,
is to keep cool. If the great American people will
only keep their temper on both sides of the line, the trouble
will come to an end, and the question which now distracts
the country will be settled just as surely as all other difficulties
of like character which have originated in this
government have been adjusted. Let the people on both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
sides keep their self-possession, and just as other clouds have
cleared away in due time, so will this, and this great nation
shall continue to prosper as heretofore.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>He then referred to the subject of the tariff, and said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;According to my political education, I am inclined to
believe that the people in the various portions of the country
should have their own views carried out through their representatives
in Congress. That consideration of the tariff bill
should not be postponed until the next session of the National
Legislature. No subject should engage your representatives
more closely than that of the tariff. If I have
any recommendation to make, it will be that every man who
is called upon to serve the people, in a representative capacity,
should study the whole subject thoroughly, as I intend
to do myself, looking to all the varied interests of the common
country, so that, when the time for action arrives, adequate
protection shall be extended to the coal and iron of
Pennsylvania, and the corn of Illinois. Permit me to express
the hope that this important subject may receive such consideration
at the hands of your representatives that the
interests of no part of the country may be overlooked, but
that all sections may share in the common benefits of a just
and equitable tariff.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. Lincoln, upon his arrival in Cleveland, adverted to the
same subject in the following terms:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;It is with you, the people, to advance the great cause of
the Union and the Constitution, and not with any one man.
It rests with you alone. This fact is strongly impressed on
my mind at present. In a community like this, whose appearance
testifies to their intelligence, I am convinced that
the cause of liberty and the Union can never be in danger.
Frequent allusion is made to the excitement at present existing
in national politics. I think there is no occasion for any
excitement. The crisis, as it is called, is altogether an artificial
crisis. In all parts of the nation, there are differences<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
of opinion in politics. There are differences of opinion even
here. You did not all vote for the person who now addresses
you. And how is it with those who are not here? Have
they not all their rights as they ever had? Do they not have
their fugitive slaves returned now as ever? Have they not
the same Constitution that they have lived under for seventy
odd years? Have they not a position as citizens of this
common country, and have we any power to change that
position? What, then, is the matter with them? Why all
this excitement? Why all these complaints? As I said
before, this crisis is all artificial. It has no foundation in
fact. It was &#8216;argued up,&#8217; as the saying is, and cannot be
argued down. Let it alone, and it will go down itself.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>On Saturday he proceeded to Buffalo, where he arrived
at evening, and was met by an immense concourse of citizens
headed by Ex-President Fillmore.</p>

<p>Arriving at the hotel, Mr. Lincoln was welcomed in a
brief speech by the acting chief magistrate, to which he made
a brief reply, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Mr. Mayor and Fellow Citizens</span>:&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;I am here to thank
you briefly for this grand reception given to me not personally,
but as the representative of our great and beloved country.
Your worthy Mayor has been pleased to mention in his
address to me, the fortunate and agreeable journey which I
have had from home&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;only it is rather a circuitous route to
the Federal Capitol. I am very happy that he was enabled,
in truth, to congratulate myself and company on that fact.
It is true, we have had nothing thus far to mar the pleasure
of the trip. We have not been met alone by those who
assisted in giving the election to me; I say not alone, but by
the whole population of the country through which we have
passed. This is as it should be. Had the election fallen to
any other of the distinguished candidates instead of myself,
under the peculiar circumstances, to say the least, it would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>have been proper for all citizens to have greeted him as you
now greet me. It is an evidence of the devotion of the whole
people to the Constitution, the Union, and the perpetuity of
the liberties of this country. I am unwilling, on any occasion,
that I should be so meanly thought of as to have it supposed
for a moment that these demonstrations are tendered
to me personally. They are tendered to the country, to the
institutions of the country, and to the perpetuity of the liberties
of the country for which these institutions were made and
created. Your worthy mayor has thought fit to express the
hope that I may be able to relieve the country from the present,
or, I should say, the threatened difficulties. I am sure
I bring a heart true to the work. For the ability to perform
it, I trust in that Supreme Being who has never forsaken this
favored land, through the instrumentality of this great and
intelligent people. Without that assistance I should surely
fail; with it I cannot fail. When we speak of the threatened
difficulties to the country, it is natural that it should be expected
that something should be said by myself with regard to
particular measures. Upon more mature reflection, however,
I think,&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;and others will agree with me&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;that, when it is considered
that these difficulties are without precedent, and never
have been acted upon by any individual situated as I am, it
is most proper that I should wait and see the developments,
and get all the light possible, so that, when I do speak
authoritatively, I may be as near right as possible. When I
shall speak authoritatively, I hope to say nothing inconsistent
with the Constitution, the Union, the rights of all the States,
of each State, and of each section of the country, and not to
disappoint the reasonable expectations of those who have
confided to me their votes. In this connection, allow me to
say that you, as a portion of the great American people, need
only to maintain your composure, stand up to your sober
convictions of right, to your obligations to the Constitution,
and act in accordance with those sober convictions, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
clouds which now arise in the horizon will be dispelled, and
we shall have a bright and glorious future; and, when this
generation shall have passed away, tens of thousands shall
inhabit this country where only thousands inhabit it now. I
do not propose to address you at length. I have no voice for
it. Allow me again to thank you for this magnificent reception,
and bid you farewell.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. Lincoln then proceeded from Buffalo to Albany. Here
he was met by the Mayor, the City Councils, and the Legislative
Committees, and was conducted to the Capitol, where
he was welcomed by Governor Morgan, and responded briefly,
as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Governor Morgan</span>:&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;I was pleased to receive an invitation
to visit the capital of the great Empire State of this
nation, while on my way to the Federal capital. I now thank
you, and you, the people of the capital of the State of New
York, for this most hearty and magnificent welcome. If I am
not at fault, the great Empire State at this time contains a
larger population than did the whole of the United States of
America at the time they achieved their national independence;
and I was proud to be invited to visit its capital, to
meet its citizens as I now have the honor to do. I am notified
by your governor that this reception is tendered by citizens
without distinction of party. Because of this, I accept it the
more gladly. In this country, and in any country where freedom
of thought is tolerated, citizens attach themselves to political
parties. It is but an ordinary degree of charity to attribute
this act to the supposition that, in thus attaching themselves
to the various parties, each man, in his own judgment,
supposes he thereby best advances the interests of the whole
country. And when an election is passed, it is altogether
befitting a free people that, until the next election, they should
be one people. The reception you have extended me to-day
is not given to me personally. It should not be so, but as the
representative, for the time being, of the majority of the nation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
If the election had fallen to any of the more distinguished citizens,
who received the support of the people, this same honor
should have greeted him that greets me this day, in testimony
of the unanimous devotion of the whole people to the Constitution,
the Union, and to the perpetual liberties of succeeding
generations in this country. I have neither the voice nor the
strength to address you at any greater length. I beg you
will, therefore, accept my most grateful thanks for this manifest
devotion&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;not to me but to the institutions of this great
and glorious country.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>He was then conducted to the Legislative halls, where, in
reply to an address of welcome, he again adverted to the troubles
of the country in the following terms:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Mr. President and Gentlemen of the Legislature Of
The State of New York</span>:&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;It is with feelings of great diffidence,
and, I may say, feelings even of awe, perhaps greater
than I have recently experienced, that I meet you here in this
place. The history of this great State, the renown of its great
men, who have stood in this chamber, and have spoken their
thoughts, all crowd around my fancy, and incline me to shrink
from an attempt to address you. Yet I have some confidence
given me by the generous manner in which you have invited
me, and the still more generous manner in which you have received
me. You have invited me and received me without distinction
of party. I could not for a moment suppose that this
has been done in any considerable degree with any reference
to my personal self. It is very much more grateful to me
that this reception and the invitation preceding it were given
to me as the representative of a free people, than it could possibly
have been were they but the evidence of devotion to me
or to any one man. It is true that, while I hold myself,
without mock-modesty, the humblest of all the individuals
who have ever been elected President of the United States, I
yet have a more difficult task to perform than any one of them
has ever encountered. You have here generously tendered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
me the support, the united support, of the great Empire State.
For this, in behalf of the nation&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;in behalf of the President
and of the future of the nation&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;in behalf of the cause of civil
liberty in all time to come&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;I most gratefully thank you. I
do not propose now to enter upon any expressions as to the
particular line of policy to be adopted with reference to the
difficulties that stand before us in the opening of the incoming
administration. I deem that it is just to the country, to myself,
to you, that I should see every thing, hear every thing,
and have every light that can possibly be brought within my
reach to aid me before I shall speak officially, in order that,
when I do speak, I may have the best possible means of
taking correct and true grounds. For this reason, I do not
now announce any thing in the way of policy for the new
Administration. When the time comes, according to the custom
of the Government, I shall speak, and speak as well as I
am able for the good of the present and of the future of this
country&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;for the good of the North and of the South&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;for the
good of one and of the other, and of all sections of it. In the
meantime, if we have patience, if we maintain our equanimity,
though some may allow themselves to run off in a burst of
passion, I still have confidence that the Almighty Ruler of
the Universe, through the instrumentality of this great and
intelligent people, can and will bring us through this difficulty,
as he has heretofore brought us through all preceding difficulties
of the country. Relying upon this, and again thanking
you, as I forever shall, in my heart, for this generous reception
you have given me, I bid you farewell.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>At Albany, he was met by a delegation from the city
authorities of New York, and on the 19th started for that
city. At Poughkeepsie, he was welcomed by the Mayor of
the city. Mr. Lincoln, in reply, said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;I am grateful for this cordial welcome, and I am gratified
that this immense multitude has come together not to meet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
the individual man, but the man who, for the time being, will
humbly but earnestly represent the majesty of the nation.
These receptions have been given me at other places, and, as
here, by men of different parties, and not by one party alone.
It shows an earnest effort on the part of all to save, not the
country, for the country can save itself, but to save the institutions
of the country&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;those institutions under which, for at
least three-quarters of a century, we have become the
greatest, the most intelligent, and the happiest people in the
world. These manifestations show that we all make common
cause for these objects; that if some of us are successful in an
election, and others are beaten, those who are beaten are not
in favor of sinking the ship in consequence of defeat, but are
earnest in their purpose to sail it safely through the voyage
in hand, and, in so far as they may think there has been any
mistake in the election, satisfying themselves to take their
chance of setting the matter right the next time. That
course is entirely right. I am not sure&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;I do not pretend to
be sure&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;that in the election of the individual who has been
elected this term, the wisest choice has been made. I fear
it has not. In the purposes and in the principles that have
been sustained, I have been the instrument selected to carry
forward the affairs of this Government. I can rely upon you,
and upon the people of the country; and with their sustaining
hand, I think that even I shall not fail in carrying the
Ship of State through the storm.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>The reception of President Lincoln in New York City was
a most imposing demonstration. Places of business were
generally closed, and hundreds of thousands were in the
streets. On the next day, he was welcomed to the city by
Mayor Wood, and replied as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Mr. Mayor</span>: It is with feelings of deep gratitude that I
make my acknowledgments for the reception given me in the
great commercial city of New York. I cannot but remember<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
that this is done by a people who do not, by a majority,
agree with me in political sentiment. It is the more grateful,
because in this I see that, for the great principles of our
Government, the people are almost unanimous. In regard
to the difficulties that confront us at this time, and of which
your Honor has thought fit to speak so becomingly and
so justly, as I suppose, I can only say that I agree in the
sentiments expressed. In my devotion to the Union, I hope
I am behind no man in the nation. In the wisdom with
which to conduct the affairs tending to the preservation of the
Union, I fear that too great confidence may have been reposed
in me; but I am sure I bring a heart devoted to the work.
There is nothing that could ever bring me to willingly consent
to the destruction of this Union, under which not only
the great commercial city of New York, but the whole
country, acquired its greatness, except it be the purpose for
which the Union itself was formed. I understand the ship to
be made for the carrying and the preservation of the cargo, and
so long as the ship can be saved with the cargo, it should never
be abandoned, unless it fails the possibility of its preservation,
and shall cease to exist, except at the risk of throwing overboard
both freight and passengers. So long, then, as it is
possible that the prosperity and the liberties of the people be
preserved in this Union, it shall be my purpose at all times to
use all my powers to aid in its perpetuation. Again thanking
you for the reception given me, allow me to come to a close.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>On the next day he left for Philadelphia. At Trenton he
remained a few hours, and visited both Houses of the Legislature.
On being received in the Senate, he thus addressed
that body:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Mr. President and Gentlemen of the Senate of The
State of New Jersey</span>:&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;I am very grateful to you for the
honorable reception of which I have been the object. I cannot
but remember the place that New Jersey holds in our early history.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
In the early Revolutionary struggle, few of the States
among the old Thirteen had more of the battle-fields of the
country within its limits than old New Jersey. May I be pardoned,
if, upon this occasion, I mention that away back in my
childhood, the earliest days of my being able to read, I got
hold of a small book, such a one as few of the younger members
have ever seen, &#8216;Weems&#8217; Life of Washington.&#8217; I remember
all the accounts there given of the battle-fields and struggles
for the liberties of the country, and none fixed themselves
upon my imagination so deeply as the struggle here at
Trenton, New Jersey. The crossing of the river&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;the
contest with the Hessians&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;the great hardships endured
at that time&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;all fixed themselves on my memory more than
any single revolutionary event; and you all know, for
you have all been boys, how these early impressions last
longer than any others. I recollect thinking then, boy even
though I was, that there must have been something more
than common that those men struggled for. I am exceedingly
anxious that that thing which they struggled for&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;that
something even more than National Independence&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;that
something that held out a great promise to all the people of
the world to all time to come&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;I am exceedingly anxious
that this Union, the Constitution, and the liberties of the
people, shall be perpetuated in accordance with the original
idea for which that struggle was made, and I shall be most
happy indeed, if I shall be an humble instrument in the
hands of the Almighty, and of this, His almost chosen
people, for perpetuating the object of that great struggle.
You give me this reception, as I understand, without distinction
of party. I learn that this body is composed of a
majority of gentlemen who, in the exercise of their best
judgment in the choice of a Chief Magistrate, did not think
I was the man. I understand, nevertheless, that they came
forward here to greet me as the Constitutional President of
the United States&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;as citizens of the United States, to meet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>the man who, for the time being, is the representative man of
the nation, united by a purpose to perpetuate the Union and
liberties of the people. As such, I accept this reception
more gratefully than I could do did I believe it was tendered
to me as an individual.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>He then passed into the Chamber of the Assembly, and
upon being introduced by the Speaker, addressed that body
as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Mr. Speaker and Gentlemen</span>:&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;I have just enjoyed the
honor of a reception by the other branch of this Legislature,
and I return to you and them my thanks for the reception
which the people of New Jersey have given, through their
chosen representatives, to me, as the representative, for the
time being, of the majesty of the people of the United
States. I appropriate to myself very little of the demonstrations
of respect with which I have been greeted. I think
little should be given to any man, but that it should be
a manifestation of adherence to the Union and the Constitution.
I understand myself to be received here by the representatives
of the people of New Jersey, a majority of whom
differ in opinion from those with whom I have acted. This
manifestation is therefore to be regarded by me as expressing
their devotion to the Union, the Constitution, and the
liberties of the people. You, Mr. Speaker, have well said,
that this is the time when the bravest and wisest look with
doubt and awe upon the aspect presented by our national
affairs. Under these circumstances, you will readily see why
I should not speak in detail of the course I shall deem it
best to pursue. It is proper that I should avail myself of
all the information and all the time at my command, in order
that when the time arrives in which I must speak officially,
I shall be able to take the ground which I deem the best and
safest, and from which I may have no occasion to swerve. I
shall endeavor to take the ground I deem most just to the
North, the East, the West, the South, and the whole country.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
I take it, I hope, in good temper&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;certainly with no malice
towards any section. I shall do all that may be in my power
to promote a peaceful settlement of all our difficulties. The
man does not live who is more devoted to peace than I am&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;none
who would do more to preserve it. But it may be
necessary to put the foot down firmly. And if I do my duty,
and do right, you will sustain me, will you not? Received,
as I am, by the members of a Legislature, the majority of
whom do not agree with me in political sentiments, I trust
that I may have their assistance in piloting the Ship of
State through this voyage, surrounded by perils as it is; for
if it should suffer shipwreck now, there will be no pilot ever
needed for another voyage.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>On his arrival in Philadelphia, he was received with great
enthusiasm, and to an address from the Mayor Mr. Lincoln
replied:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Mr. Mayor and Fellow-citizens of Philadelphia</span>:&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;I
appear before you to make no lengthy speech but to
thank you for this reception. The reception you have given
me to-night is not to me, the man, the individual, but to the
man who temporarily represents, or should represent, the
majesty of the nation. It is true, as your worthy Mayor has
said, that there is anxiety among the citizens of the United
States at this time. I deem it a happy circumstance that
this dissatisfied portion of our fellow-citizens do not point us
to any thing in which they are being injured, or are about to
be injured; for which reason I have felt all the while justified
in concluding that the crisis, the panic, the anxiety of the
country at this time, is artificial. If there be those who differ
with me upon this subject, they have not pointed out the
substantial difficulty that exists. I do not mean to say that
an artificial panic may not do considerable harm; that it has
done such I do not deny. The hope that has been expressed
by your Mayor, that I may be able to restore peace, harmony,
and prosperity to the country, is most worthy of him; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
happy indeed will I be if I shall be able to verify and fulfil
that hope. I promise you, in all sincerity, that I bring to
the work a sincere heart. Whether I will bring a head equal
to that heart, will be for future times to determine. It were
useless for me to speak of details or plans now; I shall speak
officially next Monday week, if ever. If I should not speak
then, it were useless for me to do so now. If I do speak
then, it is useless for me to do so now. When I do speak, I
shall take such grounds as I deem best calculated to restore
peace, harmony, and prosperity to the country, and tend to
the perpetuity of the nation, and the liberty of these States
and these people. Your worthy Mayor has expressed the
wish, in which I join with him, that if it were convenient for
me to remain with your city long enough to consult your
merchants and manufacturers; or, as it were, to listen to
those breathings rising within the consecrated walls wherein
the Constitution of the United States, and, I will add, the
Declaration of Independence, were originally framed and
adopted. I assure you and your Mayor, that I had hoped
on this occasion, and upon all occasions during my life, that
I shall do nothing inconsistent with the teachings of these
holy and most sacred walls. I never asked any thing that
does not breathe from those walls. All my political warfare
has been in favor of the teachings that come forth from these
sacred walls. May my right hand forget its cunning, and
my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth, if ever I prove
false to those teachings. Fellow-citizens, now allow me to
bid you good-night.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>On the next morning Mr. Lincoln visited the old &#8220;Independence
Hall,&#8221; for the purpose of raising the national flag
over it. Here he was received with a warm welcome, and
made the following address:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;I am filled with deep emotion at finding myself standing
here, in this place, where were collected the wisdom, the
patriotism, the devotion to principle, from which sprang the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
institutions under which we live. You have kindly suggested
to me that in my hands is the task of restoring peace to the
present distracted condition of the country. I can say in
return, sir, that all the political sentiments I entertain have
been drawn, so far as I have been able to draw them, from
the sentiments which originated and were given to the world
from this hall. I have never had a feeling politically that
did not spring from the sentiments embodied in the Declaration
of Independence. I have often pondered over the
dangers which were incurred by the men who assembled
here, and framed and adopted that Declaration of Independence.
I have pondered over the toils that were endured by
the officers and soldiers of the army who achieved that independence.
I have often inquired of myself what great principle
or idea it was that kept this Confederacy so long
together. It was not the mere matter of the separation of
the colonies from the mother-land, but that sentiment in the
Declaration of Independence which gave liberty, not alone to
the people of this country, but, I hope, to the world for all
future time. It was that which gave promise that in due
time the weight would be lifted from the shoulders of all men.
This is a sentiment embodied in the Declaration of Independence.
Now, my friends, can this country be saved upon
this basis? If it can, I will consider myself one of the
happiest men in the world if I can help to save it. If it
cannot be saved upon that principle, it will be truly awful.
But if this country cannot be saved without giving up that
principle, I was about to say I would rather be assassinated
on this spot than surrender it. Now, in my view of the
present aspect of affairs, there need be no bloodshed or war.
There is no necessity for it. I am not in favor of such a
course, and I may say, in advance, that there will be no
blood shed unless it be forced upon the government, and then
it will be compelled to act in self-defence.</p>

<p>&#8220;My friends, this is wholly an unexpected speech, and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
did not expect to be called upon to say a word when I came
here. I supposed it was merely to do something towards
raising the flag. I may, therefore, have said something indiscreet.
I have said nothing but what I am willing to live
by, and, if it be the pleasure of Almighty God, to die by.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>The party then proceeded to a platform erected in front
of the State House, when the President-elect was invited to
raise the flag. Mr. Lincoln responded in a brief speech,
stating his cheerful compliance with the request, and alluded
to the original flag of thirteen stars, saying that the number
had increased as time rolled on, and we now became a happy
and a powerful people, each star adding to its prosperity.
&#8220;The future,&#8221; he added, &#8220;is in the hands of the people. It is
on such an occasion as this that we can reason together, reaffirm
our devotion to the country and the principles of the
Declaration of Independence. Let us make up our mind,
that when we do put a new star upon our banner, it shall be
a fixed one, never to be dimmed by the horrors of war, but
brightened by the contentment and prosperity of peace. Let
us go on to extend the area of our usefulness, add star upon
star, until their light shall shine upon five hundred millions
of a free and happy people.&#8221;</p>

<p>The President-elect then raised the flag to the top of the
staff.</p>

<p>At half-past 9 o&#8217;clock the party left for Harrisburg. Both
Houses of the Legislature were visited by Mr. Lincoln, and to
an address of welcome he thus replied:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;I appear before you only for a very few brief remarks, in
response to what has been said to me. I thank you most
sincerely for this reception, and the generous words in which
support has been promised me upon this occasion. I thank
your great commonwealth for the overwhelming support it
recently gave, not to me personally, but the cause, which I
think a just one, in the late election. Allusion has been
made to the fact&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;the interesting fact, perhaps we should say&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
I, for the first time, appear at the Capital of the great
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania upon the birthday of the
Father of his Country, in connection with that beloved anniversary
connected with the history of this country. I have
already gone through one exceedingly interesting scene this
morning in the ceremonies at Philadelphia. Under the high
conduct of gentlemen there, I was, for the first time, allowed
the privilege of standing in Old Independence Hall, to have
a few words addressed to me there, and opening up to me an
opportunity of expressing, with much regret, that I had not
more time to express something of my own feelings, excited
by the occasion, somewhat to harmonize and give shape to
the feelings that had been really the feelings of my whole life.
Besides this, our friends there had provided a magnificent
flag of the country. They had arranged it so that I was
given the honor of raising it to the head of its staff. And
when it went up I was pleased that it went to its place by
the strength of my own feeble arm; when, according to the
arrangement, the cord was pulled, and it flaunted gloriously
to the wind without an accident, in the bright glowing sunshine
of the morning, I could not help hoping that there was
in the entire success of that beautiful ceremony at least something
of an omen of what is to come. Nor could I help
feeling then, as I often have felt, in the whole of that proceeding,
I was a very humble instrument. I had not provided
the flag; I had not made the arrangements for elevating it to
its place. I had applied but a very small portion of my
feeble strength in raising it. In the whole transaction I was
in the hands of the people who had arranged it; and if I can
have the same generous coöperation of the people of the
nation, I think the flag of our country may yet be kept
flaunting gloriously. I recur for a moment but to repeat
some words uttered at the hotel in regard to what has been
said about the military support which the General Government
may expect from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>in a proper emergency. To guard against any possible mistake
do I recur to this. It is not with any pleasure that I
contemplate the possibility that a necessity may arise in this
country for the use of the military arm. While I am exceedingly
gratified to see the manifestation upon your streets of
your military force here, and exceedingly gratified at your
promise here to use that force upon a proper emergency&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;while
I make these acknowledgements, I desire to repeat, in
order to preclude any possible misconstruction, that I do
most sincerely hope that we shall have no use for them; that
it will never become their duty to shed blood, and most
especially never to shed fraternal blood. I promise that, so
far as I have wisdom to direct, if so painful a result shall in
any wise be brought about, it shall be through no fault of
mine. Allusion has also been made by one of your honored
speakers to some remark recently made by myself at Pittsburg,
in regard to what is supposed to be the especial
interest of this great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. I
now wish only to say, in regard to that matter, that the few
remarks which I uttered on that occasion were rather carefully
worded. I took pains that they should be so. I have
seen no occasion since to add to them or subtract from them.
I leave them precisely as they stand, adding only now, that
I am pleased to have an expression from you, gentlemen of
Pennsylvania, significant that they are satisfactory to you.
And now, gentlemen of the General Assembly of the Commonwealth
of Pennsylvania, allow me to return you again
my most sincere thanks.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Arrangements had been made for his departure from Harrisburg
on the following morning; but the timely discovery
of a plot to assassinate him on his way through Baltimore&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;a
plot in which several of the leading citizens of that place
were believed to be interested, although the work was to be
done by other hands&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;caused a change in the schedule, and
on the evening of the day on which he had been received by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
the Legislature, he left on a special train for Philadelphia,
and thence proceeded in the sleeping-car attached to the regular
midnight train to Washington, where he arrived at an
early hour on the morning of the 23d.</p>

<p>As an evidence how little the extent to which unscrupulous
men were prepared to go, was understood at this time, it may
be remarked that not a few made themselves very merry over
this midnight ride&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;a leading pictorial even indulging itself
in an attempt at a humorous illustration of it, an act which,
viewed in the light of a startling event but little more than
four years later, in which a native of the same city was directly
concerned, would hardly have been repeated.</p>

<p>A few days after his arrival in Washington, the President
elect was waited upon by the Mayor and other municipal authorities,
welcoming him the city, to whom he made the following
reply:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;Mr. <span class="smcap">Mayor</span>: I thank you, and through you the municipal
authorities of this city who accompany you, for this welcome.
And as it is the first time in my life since the present phase
of politics has presented itself in this country, that I have
said anything publicly within a region of country where the
institution of slavery exists, I will take this occasion to say
that I think very much of the ill feeling which has existed,
and still exists, between the people in the sections from
whence I came and the people here, is dependent upon a
misunderstanding of one another. I therefore avail myself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
of this opportunity to assure you, Mr. Mayor, and all the
gentlemen present, that I have not now, and never have had,
any other than as kindly feelings towards you as towards
the people of my own section. I have not now, nor never
have had, any disposition to treat you in any respect otherwise
than as my own neighbors. I have not now any purpose
to withhold from you any of the benefits of the Constitution,
under any circumstances, that I would not feel myself
constrained to withhold from my neighbors; and I hope, in a
word, that when we shall become better acquainted, and I
say it with great confidence, we shall like each other the
more. I thank you for the kindness of this reception.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>On the following evening, at the close of a serenade tendered
him by the Republican Association, he thus addressed
the crowd:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">My Friends</span>: I suppose that I may take this as a compliment
paid to me, and as such please accept my thanks for it.
I have reached this city of Washington under circumstances
considerably differing from those under which any other man
has ever reached it. I am here for the purpose of taking an
official position amongst the people, almost all of whom were
politically opposed to me, and are yet opposed to me as I
suppose. I propose no lengthy address to you. I only propose
to say, as I did on yesterday, when your worthy Mayor
and Board of Aldermen called upon me, that I thought much
of the ill feeling that has existed between you and the people
of your surroundings and that people from amongst whom I
came, has depended, and now depends, upon a misunderstanding.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope that, if things shall go on as prosperously as I
believe we all desire they may, I may have it in my power to
remove something of this misunderstanding, that I may be
enabled to convince you, and the people of your section of the
country, that we regard you as in all things our equals, and
in all things entitled to the same respect and the same treatment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
that we claim for ourselves; that we are in nowise disposed,
if it were in our power, to oppress you, to deprive
you of any of your rights under the Constitution of the
United States, or even narrowly to split hairs with you in
regard to those rights, but are determined to give you, as far
as lies in our hands, all your rights under the Constitution&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;not
grudgingly, but fully and fairly. I hope that, by thus
dealing with you, we will become better acquainted, and be
better friends. And now, my friends, with these few remarks,
and again returning my thanks for this compliment,
and expressing my desire to hear a little more of your good
music, I bid you good-night.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Never, in the history of the country, has the inaugural
address of any President been so anxiously awaited as was
that of Mr. Lincoln. The most of his countrymen, even in
States whose loyalty to the Government was beyond suspicion,
were certain to be disappointed, whatever that inaugural
might prove to be. An impression prevailed, for which
no good grounds could be shown, that somehow, in some inexplicable
way, this particular address would operate as a
panacea to heal the nation&#8217;s malady. One class, who knew
not the man, hoped, almost against hope, that such concessions
would be made to the rebels as would bridge over existing
difficulties, and restore the good old times when men
could vend their goods and principles&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;or what served them
in lieu thereof&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;without being annoyed by war or rumor of
war. Another would be satisfied with nothing short of the
most positive and unqualified denunciations of the rebels,
coupled with the details in advance of dealing with them.
Still another were simply curious in the premises to know
what could be said. Whisperings, too, that the address would
be prevented by violence, and hints of assassination were
heard here and there.</p>

<p>All necessary precautions, however, having been taken to
guard against the latter contingencies, Mr. Lincoln appeared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
at the east front of the capitol, and received, at the hour appointed,
the oath of office from Chief Justice Taney. Then
followed, in a clear, steady tone of voice, in the presence of
more than ten thousand of his fellow-citizens, the address:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Fellow-citizens of the United States</span>:&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;In compliance
with a custom as old as the Government itself, I appear before
you to address you briefly, and to take, in your presence,
the oath prescribed by the Constitution of the United States
to be taken by the President before he enters on the execution
of his office.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not consider it necessary, at present, for me to discuss
those matters of administration about which there is no
special anxiety or excitement. Apprehension seems to exist
among the people of the Southern States, that, by the accession
of a Republican Administration, their property and their
peace and personal security are to be endangered. There
has never been any reasonable cause for such apprehension.
Indeed, the most ample evidence to the contrary has all the
while existed, and been open to their inspection. It is found
in nearly all the published speeches of him who now addresses
you. I do but quote from one of those speeches, when I
declare that &#8216;I have no purpose, directly or indirectly, to interfere
with the institution of slavery in the States where it
exists.&#8217; I believe I have no lawful right to do so; and I
have no inclination to do so. Those who nominated and
elected me, did so with the full knowledge that I had made
this, and made many similar declarations, and had never
recanted them. And, more than this, they placed in the
platform, for my acceptance, and as a law to themselves and
to me, the clear and emphatic resolution which I now read:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;<i>Resolved</i>, That the maintenance inviolate of the rights
of the States, and especially the right of each State to order
and control its own domestic institutions according to its own
judgment exclusively, is essential to that balance of power
on which the perfection and endurance of our political fabric<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
depend; and we denounce the lawless invasion, by armed
force, of the soil of any State or Territory, no matter under
what pretext, as among the gravest of crimes.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;I now reiterate these sentiments; and in doing so I only
press upon the public attention the most conclusive evidence
of which the case is susceptible, that the property, peace and
security of no section are to be in anywise endangered by the
now incoming administration.</p>

<p>&#8220;I add, too, that all the protection which, consistently with
the Constitution and the laws, can be given, will be cheerfully
given to all the States when lawfully demanded, for whatever
cause, as cheerfully to one section as to another.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is much controversy about the delivering up of
fugitives from service or labor. The clause I now read is
as plainly written in the Constitution as any other of its
provisions:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;No person held to service or labor in one State under
the laws thereof, escaping into another, shall, in consequence
of any law or regulation therein, be discharged from such
service or labor, but shall be delivered up on claim of the
party to whom such service or labor may be due.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is scarcely questioned that this provision was intended
by those who made it for the reclaiming of what we call fugitive
slaves; and the intention of the lawgiver is the law.</p>

<p>&#8220;All members of Congress swear their support to the
whole Constitution&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;to this provision as well as any other.
To the proposition, then, that slaves whose cases come within
the terms of this clause &#8216;shall be delivered up,&#8217; their oaths
are unanimous. Now, if they would make the effort in good
temper, could they not, with nearly equal unanimity, frame
and pass a law by means of which to keep good that unanimous
oath?</p>

<p>&#8220;There is some difference of opinion whether this clause
should be enforced by National or by State authority; but
surely that difference is not a very material one. If the slave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
is to be surrendered, it can be of but little consequence to
him or to others by which authority it is done; and should
any one, in any case, be content that this oath shall go unkept
on a merely unsubstantial controversy as to how it shall
be kept?</p>

<p>&#8220;Again, in any law upon this subject, ought not all the safeguards
of liberty known in civilized and humane jurisprudence
to be introduced, so that a free man be not, in any case, surrendered
as a slave? And might it not be well at the same
time to provide by law for the enforcement of that clause in the
Constitution which guarantees that &#8216;the citizens of each State
shall be entitled to all the privileges and immunities of citizens
in the several States?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;I take the official oath to-day with no mental reservations,
and with no purpose to construe the Constitution or laws by
any hypercritical rules; and while I do not choose now to
specify particular acts of Congress as proper to be enforced, I
do suggest that it will be much safer for all, both in official
and private stations, to conform to and abide by all those acts
which stand unrepealed, than to violate any of them, trusting
to find impunity in having them held to be unconstitutional.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is seventy-two years since the first inauguration of a
President under our National Constitution. During that
period, fifteen different and very distinguished citizens have in
succession administered the executive branch of the Government.
They have conducted it through many perils, and
generally with great success. Yet, with all this scope for
precedent, I now enter upon the same task, for the brief constitutional
term of four years, under great and peculiar difficulties.</p>

<p>&#8220;A disruption of the Federal Union, heretofore only menaced,
is now formidably attempted. I hold that in the contemplation
of universal law and of the Constitution, the Union of
these States is perpetual. Perpetuity is implied, if not expressed,
in the fundamental law of all national governments.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
It is safe to assert that no government proper ever had a provision
in its organic law for its own termination. Continue
to execute all the express provisions of our National Constitution,
and the Union will endure forever, it being impossible
to destroy it, except by some action not provided for in the
instrument itself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Again, if the United States be not a government proper,
but an association of States in the nature of a contract merely,
can it, as a contract, be peaceably unmade by less than all the
parties who made it? One party to a contract may violate
it&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;break it, so to speak; but does it not require all to lawfully
rescind it? Descending from these general principles,
we find the proposition that in legal contemplation the Union
is perpetual, confirmed by the history of the Union itself.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Union is much older than the Constitution. It was
formed, in fact, by the Articles of Association in 1774. It
was matured and continued in the Declaration of Independence
in 1776. It was further matured, and the faith of all
the then thirteen States expressly plighted and engaged that
it should be perpetual, by the Articles of the Confederation, in
1778; and, finally, in 1787, one of the declared objects for
ordaining and establishing the Constitution was to form a
more perfect Union. But if the destruction of the Union by
one or by a part only of the States be lawfully possible, the
Union is less than before, the Constitution having lost the vital
element of perpetuity.</p>

<p>&#8220;It follows from these views that no State, upon its own mere
motion, can lawfully get out of the Union; that resolves and
ordinances to that effect, are legally void; and that acts of
violence within any State or States against the authority of
the United States, are insurrectionary or revolutionary, according
to circumstances.</p>

<p>&#8220;I therefore consider that, in view of the Constitution and
the laws, the Union is unbroken, and, to the extent of my
ability, I shall take care, as the Constitution itself expressly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
enjoins upon me, that the laws of the Union shall be faithfully
executed in all the States. Doing this, which I deem to be
only a simple duty on my part, I shall perfectly perform it,
so far as is practicable, unless my rightful masters, the American
people, shall withhold the requisition, or in some authoritative
manner direct the contrary.</p>

<p>&#8220;I trust this will not be regarded as a menace, but only
as the declared purpose of the Union that it will constitutionally
defend and maintain itself.</p>

<p>&#8220;In doing this there need be no bloodshed or violence, and
there shall be none unless it is forced upon the National
authority.</p>

<p>&#8220;The power confided to me <i>will be used to hold, occupy, and
possess the property and plants belonging to the Government</i>,
and collect the duties and imposts; but beyond what may be
necessary for these objects there will be no invasion, no using
of force against or among the people anywhere.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where hostility to the United States shall be so great and
so universal as to prevent competent resident citizens from
holding Federal offices, there will be no attempt to force obnoxious
strangers among the people that object. While the
strict legal right may exist of the Government to enforce the
exercise of these offices, the attempt to do so would be so
irritating, and so nearly impracticable withal, that I deem it
best to forego, for the time, the uses of such offices.</p>

<p>&#8220;The mails, unless repelled, will continue to be furnished in
all parts of the Union.</p>

<p>&#8220;So far as possible, the people everywhere shall have that
sense of perfect security which is most favorable to calm
thought and reflection.</p>

<p>&#8220;The course here indicated will be followed, unless current
events and experience shall show a modification or change to
be proper; and in every case and exigency my best discretion
will be exercised according to the circumstances actually existing,
and with a view and hope of a peaceful solution of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
National troubles and the restoration of fraternal sympathies
and affections.</p>

<p>&#8220;That there are persons, in one section or another, who
seek to destroy the Union at all events, and are glad of any
pretext to do it, I will neither affirm nor deny. But if there
be such, I need address no word to them.</p>

<p>&#8220;To those, however, who really love the Union, may I not
speak, before entering upon so grave a matter as the destruction
of our National fabric, with all its benefits, its memories,
and its hopes? Would it not be well to ascertain why we do
it? Will you hazard so desperate a step, while any portion
of the ills you fly from have no real existence? Will you, while
the certain ills you fly to are greater than all the real ones
you fly from? Will you risk the commission of so fearful a
mistake? All profess to be content in the Union if all constitutional
rights can be maintained. Is it true, then, that
any right, plainly written in the Constitution, has been
denied? I think not. Happily the human mind is so constituted,
that no party can reach to the audacity of doing this.</p>

<p>&#8220;Think, if you can, of a single instance in which a plainly-written
provision of the Constitution has ever been denied.
If, by the mere force of numbers, a majority should deprive
a minority of any clearly-written constitutional right, it might,
in a moral point of view, justify revolution; it certainly
would, if such right were a vital one. But such is not our
case.</p>

<p>&#8220;All the vital rights of minorities and of individuals are so
plainly assured to them by affirmations and negations, guaranties
and prohibitions in the Constitution, that controversies
never arise concerning them. But no organic law can ever
be framed with a provision specifically applicable to every
question which may occur in practical administration. No
foresight can anticipate, nor any document of reasonable
length contain, express provisions for all possible questions.
Shall fugitives from labor be surrendered by National or by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>State authorities? The Constitution does not expressly say.
Must Congress protect slavery in the Territories? The
Constitution does not expressly say. From questions of this
class, spring all our constitutional controversies, and we
divide upon them into majorities and minorities.</p>

<p>&#8220;If the minority will not acquiesce, the majority must, or
the Government must cease. There is no alternative for
continuing the Government but acquiescence on the one side
or the other. If a minority in such a case will secede rather
than acquiesce, they make a precedent which, in turn, will
ruin and divide them, for a minority of their own will secede
from them whenever a majority refuses to be controlled by
such a minority. For instance, why not any portion of a
new Confederacy, a year or two hence, arbitrarily secede
again, precisely as portions of the present Union now claim
to secede from it? All who cherish disunion sentiments are
now being educated to the exact temper of doing this. Is
there such perfect identity of interests among the States to
compose a new Union as to produce harmony only, and prevent
renewed secession? Plainly, the central idea of secession
is the essence of anarchy.</p>

<p>&#8220;A majority held in restraint by constitutional check and
limitation, and always changing easily with deliberate changes
of popular opinions and sentiments, is the only true sovereign
of a free people. Whoever rejects it, does, of necessity, fly to
anarchy or to despotism. Unanimity is impossible; the rule
of a majority, as a permanent arrangement, is wholly inadmissible.
So that, rejecting the majority principle, anarchy
or despotism, in some form, is all that is left.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not forget the position assumed by some that constitutional
questions are to be decided by the Supreme Court,
nor do I deny that such decisions must be binding in any
case upon the parties to a suit, as to the object of that suit,
while they are also entitled to a very high respect and consideration
in all parallel cases by all other departments of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
Government; and while it is obviously possible that such
decision may be erroneous in any given case, still the evil
effect following it, being limited to that particular case, with
the chance that it may be overruled and never become a
precedent for other cases, can better be borne than could the
evils of a different practice.</p>

<p>&#8220;At the same time the candid citizen must confess that if
the policy of the Government upon the vital question affecting
the whole people is to be irrevocably fixed by the decisions
of the Supreme Court, the instant they are made, as in
ordinary litigation between parties in personal actions, the
people will have ceased to be their own masters, unless
having to that extent practically resigned their Government
into the hands of that eminent tribunal.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor is there in this view any assault upon the Court or
the Judges. It is a duty from which they may not shrink, to
decide cases properly brought before them; and it is no fault
of theirs if others seek to turn their decisions to political purposes.
One section of our country believes slavery is right
and ought to be extended, while the other believes it is wrong
and ought not to be extended; and this is the only substantial
dispute; and the fugitive slave clause of the Constitution, and
the law for the suppression of the foreign slave-trade, are
each as well enforced, perhaps, as any law can ever be in a
community where the moral sense of the people imperfectly
supports the law itself. The great body of the people abide
by the dry legal obligation in both cases, and a few break
over in each. This, I think, can not be perfectly cured, and
it would be worse in both cases after the separation of the
sections than before. The foreign slave-trade, now imperfectly
suppressed, would be ultimately revived, without
restriction, in one section; while fugitive slaves, now only
partially surrendered, would not be surrendered at all by the
other.</p>

<p>&#8220;Physically speaking we can not separate; we can not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
remove our respective sections from each other, nor build an
impassable wall between them. A husband and wife may be
divorced, and go out of the presence and beyond the reach
of each other, but the different parts of our country can not
do this. They can not but remain face to face; and intercourse,
either amicable or hostile, must continue between
them. Is it possible, then, to make that intercourse more
advantageous or more satisfactory after separation than
before? Can aliens make treaties easier than friends can
make laws? Can treaties be more faithfully enforced between
aliens than laws can among friends? Suppose you go
to war, you can not fight always; and when, after much loss
on both sides, and no gain on either, you cease fighting, the
identical questions as to terms of intercourse are again upon
you.</p>

<p>&#8220;This country, with its institutions, belongs to the people
who inhabit it. Whenever they shall grow weary of the
existing government, they can exercise their constitutional
right of amending, or their revolutionary right to dismember
or overthrow it. I can not be ignorant of the fact that many
worthy and patriotic citizens are desirous of having the
National Constitution amended. While I make no recommendation
of amendment, I fully recognize the full authority
of the people over the whole subject, to be exercised in
either of the modes prescribed in the instrument itself, and I
should, under existing circumstances, favor rather than
oppose, a fair opportunity being afforded the people to
act upon it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will venture to add, that to me the Convention mode
seems preferable, in that it allows amendments to originate
with the people themselves, instead of only permitting them
to take or reject propositions originated by others not especially
chosen for the purpose, and which might not be precisely
such as they would wish either to accept or refuse. I understand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
that a proposed amendment to the Constitution (which
amendment, however, I have not seen) has passed Congress,
to the effect that the Federal Government shall never interfere
with the domestic institutions of States, including that
of persons held to service. To avoid misconstruction of
what I have said, I depart from my purpose not to speak of
particular amendments, so far as to say that, holding such a
provision to now be implied constitutional law, I have no
objection to its being made express and irrevocable.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Chief Magistrate derives all his authority from the
people, and they have conferred none upon him to fix the
terms for the separation of the States. The people themselves,
also, can do this if they choose, but the Executive,
as such, has nothing to do with it. His duty is to administer
the present government as it came to his hands, and to
transmit it unimpaired by him to his successor. Why should
there not be a patient confidence in the ultimate justice of
the people? Is there any better or equal hope in the world?
In our present differences is either party without faith of
being in the right? If the Almighty Ruler of nations, with
his eternal truth and justice, be on your side of the North,
or on yours of the South, that truth and that justice will
surely prevail by the judgment of this great tribunal, the
American people. By the frame of the government under
which we live, this same people have wisely given their
public servants but little power for mischief, and have with
equal wisdom provided for the return of that little to their
own hands at very short intervals. While the people retain
their virtue and vigilance, no administration, by any extreme
wickedness or folly, can very seriously injure the government
in the short space of four years.</p>

<p>&#8220;My countrymen, one and all, think calmly and well upon
this whole subject. Nothing valuable can be lost by taking
time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
&#8220;If there be an object to hurry any of you, in hot haste,
to a step which you would never take deliberately, that
object will be frustrated by taking time: but no good object
can be frustrated by it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Such of you as are now dissatisfied, still have the old
Constitution unimpaired, and on the sensitive point, the laws
of your own framing under it; while the new administration
will have no immediate power, if it would, to change either.</p>

<p>&#8220;If it were admitted that you who are dissatisfied hold
the right side in the dispute, there is still no single reason for
precipitate action. Intelligence, patriotism, Christianity,
and a firm reliance on Him who has never yet forsaken this
favored land, are still competent to adjust, in the best way,
all our present difficulties.</p>

<p>&#8220;In your hands, my dissatisfied fellow-countrymen, and
not in mine, is the momentous issue of civil war. The Government
will not assail you.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can have no conflict without being yourselves the
aggressors. You have no oath registered in Heaven to destroy
the Government; while I shall have the most solemn
one to &#8216;preserve, protect, and defend&#8217; it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am loath to close. We are not enemies, but friends.
We must not be enemies. Though passion may have
strained, it must not break our bonds of affection.</p>

<p>&#8220;The mystic cords of memory, stretching from every battle-field
and patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone
all over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the
Union, when again touched, as surely they will be, by the
better angels of our nature.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>One point was established, at least, by this inaugural,
whatever uncertainties might cluster about it&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;we had, at
last, a Government. No Buchanan ruled the hour. Loyal
men of every shade breathed more freely. At the same time,
the whole drift was toward securing, if possible, an honorable
reconciliation. If, after this lucid, temperate statement of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
the plans and purposes of the new Administration, the blow
must fall, which all wished to avoid, it was encouraging to
feel&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;as every one who heard Mr. Lincoln on that eventful
day must have felt&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;that a man was at the helm who had
firm faith that the organic law, so far from providing for the
dissolution of the Union, had vitality and force within itself
sufficient to defend the nation against dangers from within as
well as from without.</p>

<p>The announcement of the President&#8217;s cabinet, likewise&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;composed,
as it was, of the ablest men in his own party, the
majority of whom had been deemed worthy of presentation
as candidates for the high office which he held&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;imparted
confidence to all who wished well to the country. The able
pen of the Secretary of State was at once called into requisition
to communicate, through the newly appointed ministers
abroad, the true state of affairs to the European powers. As
speedily as possible the Departments were purged of disloyal
officials, although the deceptions and subterfuges which constituted
a goodly portion of the stock in trade of the rebellion rendered
this a work of more time than was satisfactory to many.</p>

<p>The Davis dynasty, at Montgomery, having, on the 9th of
March, passed an act to organize a Confederate army, two
persons&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;one from Alabama and the other from Georgia&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;announced
themselves, three days later, as &#8220;Confederate
Commissioners,&#8221; accredited for the purpose of negotiating a
treaty. The President declined to recognize these &#8220;Commissioners,&#8221;
who were referred to a copy of his inaugural enclosed
for a full statement of his views.</p>

<p>On the 21st of March, Alexander H. Stephens, of Georgia,
Vice-President of the Montgomery traitors, up to that time
regarded as one of the most moderate&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;as he certainly was
one of the ablest&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;of the conspirators, in a speech at Savannah,
silenced all questionings as to the intent of himself and
co-workers.</p>

<p>He said on that occasion:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;The new Constitution (that adopted at Montgomery) has
put at rest forever all the agitating questions relating to our
peculiar institutions&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;African slavery as it exists among us&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;the
proper status of the negro in our form of civilization.
This was the immediate cause of the late rupture and present
revolution. Jefferson, in his forecast, had anticipated this
as the rock upon which the old Union would split. He was
right. What was conjecture with him, is now a realized fact.
But whether he fully comprehended the great truth upon
which that rock stood and stands, may be doubted. The
prevailing ideas, entertained by him and most of the leading
statesmen, at the time of the formation of the old Constitution,
were, that the enslavement of the African was in violation
of the laws of nature; that it was wrong in principle,
socially, morally, and politically. It was an evil they knew
not well how to deal with; but the general opinion of the
men of that day was, that, somehow or other, in the order of
Providence, the institution would be evanescent and pass
away. * * *</p>

<p>&#8220;Our new Government is founded upon exactly the opposite
ideas. Its foundations are laid, its corner-stone rests
upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white
man; that slavery, subordination to the superior race, is his
natural and normal condition. This, our new Government,
is the first in the history of the world based upon this great
physical, philosophical, and moral truth. * * * It is
upon this, as I have stated, our social fabric is firmly planted;
and I can not permit myself to doubt the ultimate success of
a full recognition of this principle throughout the civilized and
enlightened world. * * * This stone, which was rejected
by the first builders, &#8216;is become the chief stone of the
corner&#8217; in our new edifice.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>On the 13th of April, the President was waited upon by a
committee from a Convention of the State of Virginia, which
Convention was discussing the question whether to go with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
the States already in rebellion, or to remain in the Union, for
the sake of furthering the ends of the rebels. The object of
the visit, and its result, may be determined from Mr. Lincoln&#8217;s
response:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>:&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;As a committee of the Virginia Convention,
now in session, you present me a preamble and resolution,
in these words:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;<span class="smcap">Whereas</span>, In the opinion of this Convention, the uncertainty
which prevails in the public mind as to the policy
which the Federal Executive intends to pursue towards the
seceded States is extremely injurious to the industrial and
commercial interests of the country, tends to keep up an excitement
which is unfavorable to the adjustment of the pending
difficulties, and threatens a disturbance of the public
peace; therefore,</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Resolved</i>, That a committee of three delegates be appointed
to wait on the President of the United States, present
to him this preamble, and respectfully ask him to communicate
to this Convention the policy which the Federal Executive
intends to pursue in regard to the Confederate States.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;In answer, I have to say, that having, at the beginning
of my official term, expressed my intended policy as plainly
as I was able, it is with deep regret and mortification I now
learn there is great and injurious uncertainty in the public
mind as to what that policy is, and what course I intend to
pursue. Not having as yet seen occasion to change, it is now
my purpose to pursue the course marked out in the inaugural
address. I commend a careful consideration of the whole
document as the best expression I can give to my purposes.
As I then and therein said, I now repeat, &#8216;The power confided
in me, will be used to hold, occupy, and possess property
and places belonging to the Government, and to collect
the duties and imposts; but beyond what is necessary for
these objects, there will be no invasion, no using of force<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
against or among the people anywhere.&#8217; By the words
&#8216;property and places belonging to the Government,&#8217; I chiefly
allude to the military posts and property which were in possession
of the government when it came into my hands. But
if, as now appears to be true, in pursuit of a purpose to drive
the United States authority from these places, an unprovoked
assault has been made upon Fort Sumter, I shall hold myself
at liberty to repossess it, if I can, like places which had been
seized before the Government was devolved upon me, and in
any event I shall, to the best of my ability, repel force by
force. In case it proves true that Fort Sumter has been
assaulted, as is reported, I shall, perhaps, cause the United
States mails to be withdrawn from all the States which claim
to have seceded, believing that the commencement of actual
war against the Government justifies and possibly demands
it. I scarcely need to say that I consider the military forts
and property, situated within the States which claim to have
seceded, as yet belonging to the Government of the United
States, as much as they did before the supposed secession.
Whatever else I may do for the purpose, I shall not attempt
to collect the duties and imposts by any armed invasion of
any part of the country&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;not meaning by this, however, that
I may not land a force deemed necessary to relieve a fort upon
the border of the country. From the fact that I have quoted
a part of the inaugural address, it must not be inferred that I
repudiate any other part, the whole of which I reaffirm, except
so far as what I now say of the mails may be regarded
as a modification.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Fort Sumter fell on the day following the reception of these
commissioners, after every effort, consistent with the means
at the disposal of the government, had been made to prevent
what then seemed a catastrophe. This action could bear but
one interpretation. A reconciliation of difficulties was utterly
impracticable. An appeal had been made to the sword.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
The power and authority of the United States had been defied
and insulted. No loyal man could now hesitate. If, however,
there were any who, even then, clung to the fallacy that
compromise could save us, Abraham Lincoln was not of the
number.</p>

<p>Sumter fell, but the nation arose. With one mind the
Free States determined that the rebellion must be put down.
All were ablaze with patriotic fire. The traitors at heart,
who lurked in the loyal States, found it a wise precaution to
float with the current. The shrewder ones among them saw
well how such a course would give them vantage-ground
when the reaction, which they hoped, and for which in secret
they labored, should come. But the great mass of the people
would not have admitted the possibility of any reaction&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;action
was to continue the order of the day until the business

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>On the 15th of April, 1861, the President issued his first
proclamation:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Whereas</span>, The laws of the United States have been for
some time past, and now are opposed, and the execution
thereof obstructed, in the States of South Carolina, Georgia,
Alabama, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas, by
combinations too powerful to be suppressed by the ordinary
course of judicial proceedings, or by the powers vested in
the marshals by law; now, therefore, I, <span class="smcap">Abraham Lincoln</span>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
President of the United States, in virtue of the power in me
vested by the Constitution and the laws, have thought fit to
call forth, and hereby do call forth, the militia of the several
States of the Union to the aggregate number of seventy-five
thousand, in order to suppress said combinations and to cause
the laws to be duly executed.</p>

<p>&#8220;The details for this object will be immediately communicated
to the State authorities through the War Department.
I appeal to all loyal citizens to favor, facilitate, and aid this
effort to maintain the honor, the integrity, and existence of
our national Union, and the perpetuity of popular government,
and to redress wrongs already long enough endured.
I deem it proper to say that the first service assigned to the
forces hereby called forth, will probably be to repossess the
forts, places, and property which have been seized from the
Union; and in every event the utmost care will be observed,
consistently with the objects aforesaid, to avoid any devastation,
any destruction of, or interference with property, or any
disturbance of peaceful citizens of any part of the country;
and I hereby command the persons composing the combinations
aforesaid, to disperse and retire peaceably to their
respective abodes, within twenty days from this date.</p>

<p>&#8220;Deeming that the present condition of public affairs presents
an extraordinary occasion, I do hereby, in virtue of the
power in me vested by the Constitution, convene both Houses
of Congress. The Senators and Representatives are, therefore,
summoned to assemble at their respective chambers at
twelve o&#8217;clock, noon, on Thursday, the fourth day of July
next, then and there to consider and determine such measures
as in their wisdom, the public safety and interest may seem
to demand.</p>

<p>&#8220;In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand, and
caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Done at the City of Washington, this fifteenth day of
April, in the year of our Lord, one thousand eight hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
and sixty-one, and of the independence of the United States
the eighty-fifth.</p>

<p>
&#8220;By the President:      <span class="right"><span class="smcap">Abraham Lincoln</span></span><br />

&#8220;<span class="smcap">William H. Seward</span>, Secretary of State.&#8221;<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>In response to this proclamation enthusiastic public meetings
were held throughout the loyal States; all party lines
seemed obliterated; enlistments were almost universal;
Washington, which was at one time in imminent danger, was
soon considered amply defended. The majority entertained
no doubt that with the force summoned the rebellion would
be nipped in the bud; the more sagacious minority shook
their heads, and wished that a million of men had been
asked.</p>

<p>An excellent opportunity was afforded to the border slave
States for pronouncing their election&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;whether to stand by
the Government, or, practically, to furnish aid and comfort to
the rebels. Magoffin, Governor of Kentucky, was soon heard
from: &#8220;Kentucky will furnish no troops,&#8221; said he, &#8220;for the
wicked purpose of subduing her sister Southern States.&#8221;
Letcher, of Virginia: &#8220;The militia of Virginia will not be
furnished to the powers at Washington for any such case or
purpose as they have in view;&#8221; and on the 17th, the State
was dragooned into passing, in secret, an ordinance of secession,
and immediately commenced those warlike preparations,
whose evil fruits she was destined so soon and in so much
sorrow to reap. The Executives of Tennessee and North
Carolina refused compliance; and those States, together with
Arkansas, went over to the &#8220;Confederacy.&#8221;</p>

<p>How was the call for troops received by the rebel conclave
at Montgomery? They laughed.</p>

<p>The first blood shed in the war was in the streets of Baltimore,
on the 19th of April. Massachusetts troops, passing
through that city for the defence of the common capitol, were
attacked by a mob, instigated and encouraged by men of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
property and social standing. The State hung trembling in
the balance between loyalty and treason. Had its geographical
position been other than it was, it would have undeniably
embraced the fortune of the South. Its Governor was, however,
strongly inclined to support the Government, although
the peculiar circumstances in which he was placed called for
peculiar tact and dexterity in management. It was seriously
proposed that no more troops should be sent through Baltimore.</p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>The day following this attack, the President sent the
following letter in reply to a communication broaching this
modest proposition:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sigright">

&#8220;<i>Washington</i>, April 20th, 1861.</p>

<p class="in0">&#8220;<span class="smcap">Governor Hicks and Mayor Brown</span>:<br />
</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>:&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;Your letter by Messrs. Bond, Dobbin, and
Brune, is received. I tender you both my sincere thanks for
your efforts to keep the peace in the trying situation in which
you are placed. For the future, troops <i>must</i> be brought here,
but I make no point of bringing them <i>through</i> Baltimore.</p>

<p>&#8220;Without any military knowledge myself, of course I
must leave details to General Scott. He hastily said this
morning in presence of those gentlemen, &#8216;March them <i>around</i>
Baltimore, and not through it.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;I sincerely hope the General, on fuller reflection, will consider
this practical and proper, and that you will not object
to it. By this a collision of the people of Baltimore with

seek it. I hope you will exert your influence to prevent
this. Now and ever, I shall do all in my power for peace,

<p>To a delegation of rebel sympathizers from the same
State, who demanded a cessation of hostilities until Congress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
should assemble, and accompanied their demand with the
statement that seventy-five thousand Marylanders would
dispute the passage of any more United States troops over
the soil of that State, he quietly remarked that he presumed
there was room enough in the State to bury that number, and
declined to accede to their proposal. The Maryland imbroglio
was, after no great time, adjusted, and ample precautions
taken to guard against any future trouble in that quarter.</p>

<p>On the 19th of April, every port of the States in rebellion
was declared blockaded by the following proclamation:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Whereas</span>, An insurrection against the Government of
the United States has broken out in the States of South
Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana,
and Texas, and the laws of the United States for the collection
of the revenue can not be efficiently executed therein
conformably to that provision of the Constitution which
requires duties to be uniform throughout the United States:</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">And Whereas</span>, A combination of persons, engaged in
such insurrection, have threatened to grant pretended letters
of marque to authorize the bearers thereof to commit assaults
on the lives, vessels, and property of good citizens of the
country lawfully engaged in commerce on the high seas, and
in waters of the United States:</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">And Whereas</span>, An Executive Proclamation has already
been issued, requiring the persons engaged in these disorderly
proceedings to desist therefrom, calling out a militia force
for the purpose of repressing the same, and convening Congress
in extraordinary session to deliberate and determine
thereon:</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the
United States, with a view to the same purposes before mentioned,
and to the protection of the public peace, and the
lives and property of quiet and orderly citizens pursuing
their lawful occupations, until Congress shall have assembled
and deliberated on the said unlawful proceedings, or until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
the same shall have ceased, have further deemed it advisable
to set on foot a blockade of the ports within the States aforesaid,
in pursuance of the laws of the United States, and of
the laws of nations in such cases provided. For this purpose
a competent force will be posted so as to prevent
entrance and exit of vessels from the ports aforesaid. If,
therefore, with a view to violate such blockade, a vessel
shall approach, or shall attempt to leave any of the said
ports, she will be duly warned by the commander of one of
the blockading vessels, who will indorse on her register the
fact and date of such warning; and if the same vessel shall
again attempt to enter or leave the blockaded port, she will
be captured and sent to the nearest convenient port, for such
proceedings against her and her cargo as prize, as may be
deemed advisable.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I hereby proclaim and declare, that if any person,
under the pretended authority of said States, or under any
other pretence, shall molest a vessel of the United States,
or the persons or cargo on board of her, such person will be
held amenable to the laws of the United States for the
prevention and punishment of piracy.</p>

&#8220;<span class="smcap">William H. Seward</span>, Secretary of State.&#8221;<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>On the 27th of April, the following additional proclamation
was issued:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Whereas</span>, For the reasons assigned in my proclamation
of the 19th instant, a blockade of the ports of the States of
South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi,
and Texas was ordered to be established; <span class="smcap">And
whereas</span>, since that date public property of the United States
has been seized, the collection of the revenue obstructed, and
duly commissioned officers of the United States, while engaged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
in executing the orders of their superiors, have been
arrested and held in custody as prisoners, or have been
impeded in the discharge of their official duties, without due
legal process, by persons claiming to act under authority of
the States of Virginia and North Carolina, an efficient
blockade of the ports of these States will therefore also be
established.</p>

<p>&#8220;In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand, and
caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Done at the City of Washington, this 27th day of April,
in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and
sixty-one, and of the independence of the United States the
eighty-fifth.</p>

&#8220;<span class="smcap">William H. Seward</span>, Secretary of State.&#8221;<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>This greatly affected the commercial interests of the European
powers, who made haste to announce that the blockade
must be an effectual one, in order to be respected; supposing,
in common with the rebels, that they were demanding what
would prove to be an impossibility. To say that they erred
decidedly in this opinion, is but stating a matter of general
notoriety, and simply adds another to the list of serious mistakes
made, during the progress of the war, by the two
European nations most deeply interested in its issue.</p>

<p>It was soon perceived that more men would be needed in
the field, Davis, in a message to his Congress, having proposed
&#8220;to organize and hold in readiness for instant action,
in view of the exigencies of the country, an army of six
hundred thousand men.&#8221; On the 3d of May, accordingly,
another call was made, in anticipation of its ratification at the
extra session of Congress, which ratification took place, without
opposition.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Whereas</span>, Existing exigencies demand immediate and
adequate measures for the protection of the national Constitution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
and the preservation of the national Union by the
suppression of the insurrectionary combinations now existing
in several States for opposing the laws of the Union and obstructing
the execution thereof, to which end a military force,
in addition to that called forth by my Proclamation of the
fifteenth day of April, in the present year, appears to be indispensably
necessary, now, therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln,
President of the United States, and Commander-in-chief of
the Army and Navy thereof, and of the militia of the several
States, when called into actual service, do hereby call into
the service of the United States forty-two thousand and
thirty-four volunteers, to serve for a period of three years,
unless sooner discharged, and to be mustered into service as
infantry and cavalry. The proportions of each arm, and the
details of enrolment and organization will be made known
through the Department of War; and I also direct that the
regular army of the United States be increased by the addition
of eight regiments of infantry, one regiment of cavalry
and one regiment of artillery, making altogether a maximum
aggregate increase of twenty-two thousand seven hundred
and fourteen officers and enlisted men, the details of which
increase will also be made known through the Department of
War; and I further direct the enlistment, for not less than
one nor more than three years, of eighteen thousand seamen,
in addition to the present force, for the naval service of the
United States. The details of the enlistment and organization
will be made known through the Department of the
Navy. The call for volunteers, hereby made, and the direction
of the increase of the regular army, and for the enlistment
of seamen hereby given, together with the plan of organization
adopted for the volunteers and for the regular forces
hereby authorized, will be submitted to Congress as soon as
assembled.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the meantime, I earnestly invoke the coöperation of
all good citizens in the measures hereby adopted for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
effectual suppression of unlawful violence, for the impartial
enforcement of constitutional laws, and for the speediest possible
restoration of peace and order, and with those of
happiness and prosperity throughout our country.</p>

<p>&#8220;In testimony whereof, I have hereunto set my hand, and
caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.</p>

<p>On the 10th of May, 1861, the following proclamation was
promulgated:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;Whereas, An insurrection exists in the State of Florida,
by which the lives, liberty, and property of loyal citizens of
the United States are endangered.</p>

<p>&#8220;And Whereas, It is deemed proper that all needful measures
should be taken for the protection of such citizens and
all officers of the United States in the discharge of their public
duties in the State aforesaid:</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, therefore, be it known that I, Abraham Lincoln,
President of the United States, do hereby direct the commander
of the forces of the United States on the Florida coast
to permit no person to exercise any office or authority upon
the islands of Key West, the Tortugas, and Santa Rosa,
which may be inconsistent with the laws and Constitution of
the United States, authorizing him at the same time, if he
shall find it necessary, to suspend there the writ of <i>habeas
corpus</i>, and to remove from the vicinity of the United States
fortresses all dangerous or suspected persons.</p>

<p>&#8220;In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand, and
caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.</p>

<p>Volunteers meanwhile presented themselves for the defence
of the country in numbers greater than could be accepted,
and the strife was who should secure the coveted distinction
of a citizen soldier. An early movement upon the rebel
army in Virginia was contemplated, and it was confidently
anticipated that to advance was to put the enemies of the
Government to flight.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE FIRST SESSION OF CONGRESS.</span></h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">Opening of Congress&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;President&#8217;s First Message&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;Its Nature&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;Action of Congress&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;Resolution
Declaring the Object of the War&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;Bull Run&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;Its Effect.</p></blockquote>

<p>The first session of Congress during Mr. Lincoln&#8217;s Administration
commenced on the 4th of July, 1861, in pursuance
of his call to that effect. The following message was transmitted
from the Executive:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives</span>:&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;Having
been convened on an extraordinary
occasion, as authorized by the Constitution, your attention is
not called to any ordinary subject of legislation. At the
beginning of the present Presidential term, four months ago,
the functions of the Federal Government were found to be
generally suspended within the several States of South Carolina,
Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana and Florida,
excepting only those of the Post-office Department.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
&#8220;Within these States, all the Forts, Arsenals, Dock-Yards,
Custom-Houses, and the like, including the movable and stationary
property in and about them, had been seized, and
were held in open hostility to this Government, excepting
only Forts Pickens, Taylor and Jefferson, on and near the
Florida coast, and Fort Sumter in Charleston harbor, South
Carolina. The forts thus seized had been put in improved
condition, new ones had been built, and armed forces had
been organized, and were organizing, all avowedly with the
same hostile purpose.</p>

<p>&#8220;The forts remaining in possession of the Federal Government
in and near these States were either besieged or menaced
by warlike preparations, and especially Fort Sumter was
nearly surrounded by well-protected hostile batteries, with
guns equal in quality to the best of its own, and outnumbering
the latter as, perhaps, ten to one&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;a disproportionate
share of the Federal muskets and rifles had somehow found
their way into these States, and had been seized to be used
against the Government.</p>

<p>&#8220;Accumulations of the public revenue lying within them
had been seized for the same object. The navy was scattered
in distant seas, leaving but a very small part of it within the
immediate reach of the Government.</p>

<p>&#8220;Officers of the Federal Army had resigned in great numbers,
and of those resigning a large proportion had taken up
arms against the Government.</p>

<p>&#8220;Simultaneously, and in connection with all this, the purpose
to sever the Federal Union was openly avowed. In
accordance with this purpose an ordinance had been adopted
in each of these States, declaring the States respectively to
be separated from the National Union. A formula for instituting
a combined Government of those States had been
promulgated, and this illegal organization, in the character
of the &#8216;Confederate States,&#8217; was already invoking recognition,
aid and intervention from foreign powers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
&#8220;Finding this condition of things, and believing it to be an
imperative duty upon the incoming Executive to prevent, if
possible, the consummation of such attempt to destroy the
Federal Union, a choice of means to that end became indispensable.
This choice was made and was declared in the
Inaugural Address.</p>

<p>&#8220;The policy chosen looked to the exhaustion of all peaceful
measures before a resort to any stronger ones. It sought
only to hold the public places and property not already
wrested from the Government, and to collect the revenue,
relying for the rest on time, discussion, and the ballot-box.
It promised a continuance of the mails, at Government
expense, to the very people who were resisting the Government,
and it gave repeated pledges against any disturbances
to any of the people, or any of their rights, of all that which
a President might constitutionally and justifiably do in such
a case; every thing was forborne, without which it was
believed possible to keep the Government on foot.</p>

<p>&#8220;On the 5th of March, the present incumbent&#8217;s first full
day in office, a letter from Major Anderson, commanding at
Fort Sumter, written on the 28th of February, and received
at the War Department on the 4th of March, was by that
Department placed in his hands. This letter expressed the
professional opinion of the writer, that reinforcements could
not be thrown into that fort within the time for its relief
rendered necessary by the limited supply of provisions, and
with a view of holding possession of the same, with a force
less than twenty thousand good and well-disciplined men.
This opinion was concurred in by all the officers of his command,
and their memoranda on the subject were made
inclosures of Major Anderson&#8217;s letter. The whole was immediately
laid before Lieutenant-General Scott, who at once
concurred with Major Anderson in his opinion. On reflection,
however, he took full time, consulting with other officers, both
of the Army and Navy, and at the end of four days came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
reluctantly but decidedly to the same conclusion as before.
He also stated at the same time that no such sufficient force
was then at the control of the Government, or could be raised
and brought to the ground, within the time when the provisions
in the fort would be exhausted. In a purely military
point of view, this reduced the duty of the Administration in
the case to the mere matter of getting the garrison safely out
of the fort.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was believed, however, that to so abandon that position,
under the circumstances, would be utterly ruinous; that the
necessity under which it was to be done would not be fully
understood; that by many it would be construed as a part of
a voluntary policy; that at home it would discourage the
friends of the Union, embolden its adversaries, and go far to
insure to the latter a recognition abroad; that, in fact, it
would be our national destruction consummated. This could
not be allowed. Starvation was not yet upon the garrison,
and ere it would be reached, Fort Pickens might be reinforced.
This last would be a clear indication of policy, and
would better enable the country to accept the evacuation of
Fort Sumter as a military necessity. An order was at once
directed to be sent for the landing of the troops from the
steamship Brooklyn into Fort Pickens. This order could not
go by land, but must take the longer and slower route by
sea. The first return news from the order was received just
one week before the fall of Sumter. The news itself was
that the officer commanding the Sabine, to which vessel the
troops had been transferred from the Brooklyn, acting upon
some quasi armistice of the late Administration, and of the
existence of which the present Administration, up to the time
the order was dispatched, had only too vague and uncertain
rumors to fix attention, had refused to land the troops. To
now reinforce Fort Pickens before a crisis would be reached
at Fort Sumter, was impossible, rendered so by the near
exhaustion of provisions at the latter named fort. In precaution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
against such a conjuncture the Government had a
few days before commenced preparing an expedition, as well
adapted as might be, to relieve Fort Sumter, which expedition
was intended to be ultimately used or not, according to
circumstances. The strongest anticipated case for using it
was now presented, and it was resolved to send it forward as
had been intended. In this contingency it was also resolved
to notify the Governor of South Carolina that he might expect
an attempt would be made to provision the fort, and that if
the attempt should not be resisted there would be no attempt
to throw in men, arms or ammunition, without further notice,
or in case of an attack upon the fort. This notice was
accordingly given, whereupon the fort was attacked and
bombarded to its fall, without even awaiting the arrival of
the provisioning expedition.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is thus seen that the assault upon and reduction of
Fort Sumter, was in no sense, a matter of self-defense on
the part of the assailants. They well knew that the garrison
in the fort could by no possibility commit aggression upon
them; they knew they were expressly notified that the giving
of bread to the few brave and hungry men of the garrison
was all which would, on that occasion, be attempted, unless
themselves, by resisting so much, should provoke more.
They knew that this Government desired to keep the garrison
in the fort, not to assail them, but merely to maintain visible
possession, and thus to preserve the Union from actual and
immediate dissolution; trusting, as hereinbefore stated, to
time, discussion, and the ballot-box for final adjustment, and
they assailed and reduced the fort, for precisely the reverse
object, to drive out the visible authority of the Federal Union,
and thus force it to immediate dissolution; that this was
their object the Executive well understood, having said to
them in the Inaugural Address, &#8216;You can have no conflict
without being yourselves the aggressors.&#8217; He took pains not
only to keep this declaration good, but also to keep the case<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
so far from ingenious sophistry as that the world should not
misunderstand it. By the affair at Fort Sumter, with its
surrounding circumstances, that point was reached. Then
and thereby the assailants of the Government began the
conflict of arms&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;without a gun in sight, or in expectancy, to
return their fire, save only the few in the fort sent to that
harbor years before, for their own protection, and still ready
to give that protection in whatever was lawful. In this act,
discarding all else, they have forced upon the country the
distinct issue, immediate dissolution or blood, and this issue
embraces more than the fate of these United States. It
presents to the whole family of man the question whether a
Constitutional Republic or Democracy, a Government of the
people, by the same people, can or can not maintain its territorial
integrity against its own domestic foes. It presents
the question whether discontented individuals, too few in
numbers to control the Administration according to the
organic law in any case, can always, upon the pretenses made
in this case, or any other pretenses, or arbitrarily without any
pretense, break up their Government, and thus practically put
an end to free government upon the earth. It forces us to
ask, &#8216;Is there in all republics this inherent and fatal weakness?&#8217;
&#8216;Must a Government of necessity be too strong for
the liberties of its own people, or too weak to maintain its
own existence?&#8217; So viewing the issue, no choice was left but
to call out the war power of the Government, and so to resist
the force employed for its destruction by force for its
preservation. The call was made, and the response of the
country was most gratifying, surpassing, in unanimity and
spirit, the most sanguine expectation. Yet none of the
States, commonly called Slave States, except Delaware, gave
a regiment through the regular State organization. A few
regiments have been organized within some others of those
States by individual enterprise, and received into the Government
service. Of course the seceded States so called, and to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
which Texas had been joined about the time of the inauguration,
gave no troops to the cause of the Union. The Border
States, so called, were not uniform in their action, some of
them being almost for the Union, while in others, as in Virginia,
North Carolina, Tennessee, and Arkansas, the Union
sentiment was nearly repressed and silenced. The course
taken in Virginia was the most remarkable, perhaps the most
important. A Convention, elected by the people of that
State to consider this very question of disrupting the Federal
Union, was in session at the capitol of Virginia when Fort
Sumter fell.</p>

<p>&#8220;To this body the people had chosen a large majority of
professed Union men. Almost immediately after the fall of
Sumter many members of that majority went over to the
original disunion minority, and with them adopted an ordinance
for withdrawing the State from the Union. Whether
this change was wrought by their great approval of the
assault upon Sumter, or their great resentment at the Government&#8217;s
resistance to that assault, is not definitely known.
Although they submitted the ordinance for ratification to a
vote of the people, to be taken on a day then somewhat more
than a month distant, the Convention, and the Legislature,
which was also in session at the same time and place, with
leading men of the State, not members of either, immediately
commenced acting as if the State was already out of the
Union. They pushed military preparations vigorously forward
all over the State. They seized the United States
Armory at Harper&#8217;s Ferry, and the Navy Yard at Gosport,
near Norfolk. They received, perhaps invited into their
State, large bodies of troops, with their warlike appointments,
from the so-called seceded States.</p>

<p>&#8220;They formally entered into a treaty of temporary alliance
with the so-called Confederate States, and sent members to
their Congress at Montgomery, and finally they permitted
the insurrectionary Government to be transferred to their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
capitol at Richmond. The people of Virginia have thus
allowed this giant insurrection to make its nest within her
borders, and this Government has no choice left but to deal
with it where it finds it, and it has the less to regret as the
loyal citizens have, in due form, claimed its protection.
Those loyal citizens this Government is bound to recognize
and protect as being in Virginia. In the Border States, so
called, in fact the Middle States, there are those who favor
a policy which they call armed neutrality, that is, an arming
of those States to prevent the Union forces passing one way
or the disunion forces the other, over their soil. This would
be disunion completed. Figuratively speaking, it would be
the building of an impassable wall along the line of separation,
and yet not quite an impassable one, for under the guise
of neutrality it would tie the hands of the Union men, and
freely pass supplies from among them, to the insurrectionists,
which it could not do as an open enemy. At a stroke it
would take all the trouble off the hands of secession, except
only what proceeds from the external blockade. It would do
for the disunionists that which of all things they most desire,
feed them well, and give them disunion, without a struggle
of their own. It recognizes no fidelity to the Constitution,
no obligation to maintain the Union, and while very many
who have favored it are doubtless loyal citizens, it is, nevertheless,
very injurious in effect.</p>

<p>&#8220;Recurring to the action of the Government, it may be
stated that at first a call was made for seventy-five thousand
militia, and rapidly following this, a proclamation was issued
for closing the ports of the insurrectionary districts by proceedings
in the nature of a blockade. So far all was believed
to be strictly legal.</p>

<p>&#8220;At this point the insurrectionists announced their purpose
to enter upon the practice of privateering.</p>

<p>&#8220;Other calls were made for volunteers, to serve three
years, unless sooner discharged, and also for large additions to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
the regular army and navy. These measures, whether strictly
legal or not, were ventured upon under what appeared to be
a popular demand and a public necessity, trusting then, as
now, that Congress would ratify them.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is believed that nothing has been done beyond the constitutional
competency of Congress. Soon after the first call
for militia it was considered a duty to authorize the commanding
general, in proper cases, according to his discretion,
to suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus; or,
in other words, to arrest and detain, without resort to the
ordinary processes and forms of law, such individuals as he
might deem dangerous to the public safety. This authority
has purposely been exercised, but very sparingly. Nevertheless,
the legality and propriety of what has been done
under it are questioned, and the attention of the country has
been called to the proposition, that one who is sworn to take
care that the laws be faithfully executed should not himself
violate them. Of course some consideration was given to
the questions of power and propriety before this matter was
acted upon. The whole of the laws, which were required to
be faithfully executed, were being resisted, and failing of execution
in nearly one-third of the States. Must they be
allowed to finally fail of execution, even had it been perfectly
clear that, by use of the means necessary to their execution,
some single law, made in such extreme tenderness of the
citizen&#8217;s liberty that practically it relieves more of the guilty
than the innocent, should, to a very great extent, be violated?
To state the question more directly, are all the
laws but one to go unexecuted, and the Government itself to
go to pieces, lest that one be violated? Even in such a case
would not the official oath be broken, if the Government
should be overthrown when it was believed that disregarding
the single law would tend to preserve it?</p>

<p>&#8220;But it was not believed that this question was presented.
It was not believed that any law was violated. The provision<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
of the Constitution, that the privilege of the writ of
habeas corpus shall not be suspended, unless when, in cases
of rebellion or invasion, the public safety may require it, is
equivalent to a provision that such privilege may be suspended
when, in cases of rebellion or invasion, the public
safety does require it. It was decided that we have a case
of rebellion, and that the public safety does require the
qualified suspension of the privilege of the writ, which was
authorized to be made. Now, it is insisted that Congress,
and not the Executive, is vested with this power. But the
Constitution itself is silent as to which or who is to exercise
the power; and as the provision was plainly made for a dangerous
emergency, it cannot be believed that the framers of
the instrument intended that in every case the danger should
run its course until Congress could be called together, the
very assembling of which might be prevented, as was intended
in this case by the rebellion. No more extended
argument is now afforded, as an opinion at some length will
probably be presented by the Attorney-General. Whether
there shall be any legislation on the subject, and if so, what,
is subject entirely to the better judgment of Congress. The
forbearance of this Government had been so extraordinary,
and so long continued, as to lead some foreign nations to
shape their action as if they supposed the early destruction
of our National Union was probable. While this, on discovery,
gave the Executive some concern, he is now happy to
say that the sovereignty and rights of the United States are
now everywhere practically respected by foreign powers, and
a general sympathy with the country is manifested throughout
the world.</p>

<p>&#8220;The reports of the Secretaries of the Treasury, War, and
the Navy, will give the information, in detail, deemed necessary
and convenient for your deliberation and action, while
the Executive and all the Departments will stand ready<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
to supply omissions or to communicate new facts considered
important for you to know.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is now recommended that you give the legal means for
making this contest a short and decisive one; that you place
at the control of the Government for the work, at least
400,000 men and $400,000,000; that number of men is about
one-tenth of those of proper ages within the regions where
apparently all are willing to engage, and the sum is less than
a twenty-third part of the money value owned by the men
who seem ready to devote the whole. A debt of $600,000,000
now is a less sum per head than was the debt of our Revolution
when we came out of that struggle, and the money
value in the country bears even a greater proportion to what
it was then than does the population. Surely each man has
as strong a motive now to preserve our liberties, as each had
then to establish them.</p>

<p>&#8220;A right result at this time will be worth more to the
world than ten times the men and ten times the money. The
evidence reaching us from the country, leaves no doubt that
the material for the work is abundant, and that it needs only
the hand of legislation to give it legal sanction, and the hand
of the Executive to give it practical shape and efficiency.
One of the greatest perplexities of the Government is to
avoid receiving troops faster than it can provide for them;
in a word, the people will save their Government if the
Government will do its part only indifferently well. It might
seem at first thought to be of little difference whether the
present movement at the South be called secession or rebellion.
The movers, however, well understand the difference.
At the beginning they knew that they could never raise their
treason to any respectable magnitude by any name which
implies violation of law; they knew their people possessed
as much of moral sense, as much of devotion to law and
order, and as much pride in its reverence for the history and
government of their common country, as any other civilized
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>and patriotic people. They knew they could make no advancement
directly in the teeth of these strong and noble
sentiments. Accordingly they commenced by an insidious
debauching of the public mind; they invented an ingenious
sophism, which, if conceded, was followed by perfectly logical
steps through all the incidents of the complete destruction of
the Union. The sophism itself is that any State of the
Union may, consistently with the nation&#8217;s Constitution, and
therefore lawfully and peacefully, withdraw from the Union
without the consent of the Union or of any other State.</p>

<p>&#8220;The little disguise that the supposed right, is to be exercised
only for just cause, themselves to be the sole judge of
its justice, is too thin to merit any notice with rebellion.
Thus sugar-coated, they have been drugging the public mind
of their section for more than thirty years, and until at
length they have brought many good men to a willingness to
take up arms against the Government the day after some
assemblage of men have enacted the farcical pretence of
taking their State out of the Union, who could have been
brought to no such thing the day before. This sophism
derives much, perhaps the whole of its currency, from the
assumption that there is some omnipotent and sacred supremacy
pertaining to a State, to each State of our Federal
Union. Our States have neither more nor less power than
that reserved to them in the Union by the Constitution, no
one of them ever having been a State out of the Union.
The original ones passed into the Union before they cast off
their British Colonial dependence, and the new ones came
into the Union directly from a condition of dependence,
excepting Texas, and even Texas, in its temporary independence,
was never designated as a State. The new ones only
took the designation of States on coming into the Union,
while that name was first adopted for the old ones in and by
the Declaration of Independence. Therein the United Colonies
were declared to be <i>free</i> and <i>independent</i> States. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
even then the object plainly was not to declare their independence
of one another of the Union, but directly the contrary,
as their mutual pledge and their mutual action before,
at the time, and afterward, abundantly show. The express
plight of faith by each and all of the original thirteen States
in the Articles of Confederation two years later that the
Union shall be perpetual, is most conclusive. Having never
been States either in substance or in name outside of the
Union, whence this magical omnipotence of State rights,
asserting a claim of power to lawfully destroy the Union
itself? Much is said about the sovereignty of the States, but
the word even is not in the National Constitution, nor, as is
believed, in any of the State constitutions. What is sovereignty
in the political sense of the word? Would it be far
wrong to define it a political community without a political
superior? Tested by this, no one of our States, except
Texas, was a sovereignty, and even Texas gave up the
character on coming into the Union, by which act she acknowledged
the Constitution of the United States; and the laws
and treaties of the United States, made in pursuance of
States, have their status in the Union, made in pursuance of
the Constitution, to be for her the supreme law. The States
have their status in the Union, and they have no other legal
status. If they break from this, they can only do so against
law and by revolution. The Union and not themselves,
separately procured their independence and their liberty by
conquest or purchase. The Union gave each of them whatever
of independence and liberty it has. The Union is older
than any of the States, and, in fact, it created them as States.
Originally, some dependent Colonies made the Union, and in
turn the Union threw off their old dependence for them, and
made them States, such as they are. Not one of them ever
had a State constitution independent of the Union. Of
course it is not forgotten that all the new States formed their
constitutions before they entered the Union; nevertheless,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
dependent upon, and preparatory to coming into the Union.
Unquestionably the States have the powers and rights reserved
to them in and by the National Constitution.</p>

<p>&#8220;But among these surely are not included all conceivable
powers, however mischievous or destructive, but at most
such only as were known in the world at the time as governmental
powers, and certainly a power to destroy the Government
itself had never been known as a governmental, as a
merely administrative power. This relative matter of
National power and State rights as a principle, is no other
than the principle of generality and locality. Whatever concerns
the whole should be conferred on the whole General
Government, while whatever concerns only the State should
be left exclusively to the State. This is all there is of original
principle about it. Whether the National Constitution,
in defining boundaries between the two, has applied the principle
with exact accuracy, is not to be questioned. We are
all bound by that defining without question. What is now
combatted is the position that secession is consistent with the
Constitution, is lawful and peaceful. It is not contended
that there is any express law for it, and nothing should ever
be implied as law which leads to unjust or absurd consequences.
The nation purchased with money the countries
out of which several of these States were formed. Is it just
that they shall go off without leave and without refunding?
The nation paid very large sums in the aggregate, I believe
nearly a hundred millions, to relieve Florida of the aboriginal
tribes. Is it just that she shall now be off without consent,
or without any return? The nation is now in debt for money
applied to the benefit of these so-called seceding States, in
common with the rest. Is it just, either that creditors shall
go unpaid, or the remaining States pay the whole? A part
of the present National debt was contracted to pay the old
debt of Texas. Is it just that she shall leave and pay no
part of this herself? Again, if one State may secede, so may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>another, and when all shall have seceded none is left to pay
the debts. Is this quite just to creditors? Did we notify
them of this sage view of ours when we borrowed their
money? If we now recognize this doctrine by allowing the
seceders to go in peace, it is difficult to see what we can do
if others choose to go, or to extort terms upon which they
will promise to remain. The seceders insist that our Constitution
admits of secession. They have assumed to make a
National Constitution of their own, in which, of necessity,
they have either discarded or retained the right of secession,
as they insist exists in ours. If they have discarded it, they
thereby admit that on principle it ought not to exist in ours;
if they have retained it, by their own construction of ours
that shows that to be consistent, they must secede from one
another whenever they shall find it the easiest way of settling
their debts, or effecting any other selfish or unjust object.
The principle itself is one of disintegration, and upon which
no Government can possibly endure. If all the States save
one should assert the power to drive that one out of the
Union, it is presumed the whole class of seceder politicians
would at once deny the power, and denounce the act as the
greatest outrage upon State rights. But suppose that precisely
the same act, instead of being called driving the one
out, should be called the seceding of the others from that one,
it would be exactly what the seceders claim to do, unless,
indeed, they made the point that the one, because it is a
minority, may rightfully do what the others, because they are
a majority, may not rightfully do. These politicians are
subtle, and profound in the rights of minorities. They are
not partial to that power which made the Constitution, and
speaks from the preamble, calling itself, &#8216;We, the people.&#8217;
It may be well questioned whether there is to-day a majority
of the legally qualified voters of any State, except, perhaps,
South Carolina, in favor of disunion. There is much reason
to believe that the Union men are the majority in many, if not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
in every one of the so-called seceded States. The contrary
has not been demonstrated in any one of them. It is ventured
to affirm this, even of Virginia and Tennessee, for the
result of an election held in military camps, where the bayonets
are all on one side of the question voted upon, can
scarcely be considered as demonstrating popular sentiment.
At such an election all that large class who are at once for
the Union and against coercion would be coerced to vote
against the Union. It may be affirmed, without extravagance,
that the free institutions we enjoy have developed the
powers and improved the condition of our whole people beyond
any example in the world. Of this we now have a
striking and impressive illustration. So large an army as the
Government has now on foot was never before known, without
a soldier in it but who has taken his place there of his
own free choice. But more than this, there are many single
regiments whose members, one and another, possess full
practical knowledge of all the arts, sciences, professions, and
whatever else, whether useful or elegant, is known in the
whole world, and there is scarcely one from which there could
not be selected a President, a Cabinet, a Congress, and perhaps
a Court, abundantly competent to administer the Government
itself. Nor do I say this is not true also in the army
of our late friends, now adversaries, in this contest. But it
is so much better the reason why the Government which has
conferred such benefits on both them and us should not be
broken up. Whoever in any section proposes to abandon
such a Government, would do well to consider in deference
to what principle it is that he does it. What better he is
likely to get in its stead, whether the substitute will give, or
be intended to give so much of good to the people. There
are some foreshadowings on this subject. Our adversaries
have adopted some declarations of independence in which,
unlike our good old one penned by Jefferson, they omit the
words, &#8216;all men are created equal.&#8217; Why? They have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>adopted a temporary National Constitution, in the preamble
of which, unlike our good old one signed by Washington,
they omit, &#8216;We, the people,&#8217; and substitute, &#8216;We, the deputies
of the sovereign and independent States.&#8217; Why? Why
this deliberate pressing out of view the rights of men and the
authority of the people? This is essentially a people&#8217;s contest.
On the side of the Union it is a struggle for maintaining
in the world that form and substance of Government
whose leading object is to elevate the condition of men, to
lift artificial weights from all shoulders, to clear the paths of
laudable pursuit for all, to afford all an unfettered start and a
fair chance in the race of life, yielding to partial and temporary
departures from necessity. This is the leading object of
the Government for whose existence we contend.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am most happy to believe that the plain people understand
and appreciate this. It is worthy of note that while
in this, the Government&#8217;s hour of trial, large numbers of those
in the army and navy who have been favored with the offices,
have resigned and proved false to the hand which pampered
them, not one common soldier or common sailor is known to
have deserted his flag. Great honor is due to those officers
who remained true despite the example of their treacherous
associates, but the greatest honor and the most important fact
of all, is the unanimous firmness of the common soldiers and
common sailors. To the last man, so far as known, they have
successfully resisted the traitorous efforts of those whose commands
but an hour before they obeyed as absolute law. This
is the patriotic instinct of plain people. They understand
without an argument that the destroying the Government
which was made by Washington means no good to them.
Our popular Government has often been called an experiment.
Two points in it our people have settled: the successful establishing
and the successful administering of it. One still
remains. Its successful maintenance against a formidable
internal attempt to overthrow it. It is now for them to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
demonstrate to the world that those who can fairly carry an
election, can also suppress a rebellion; that ballots are the
rightful and peaceful successors of bullets, and that when ballots
have fairly and constitutionally decided, there can be no
successful appeal except to ballots themselves at succeeding
elections. Such will be a great lesson of peace, teaching men
that what they cannot take by an election, neither can they
take by a war, teaching all the folly of being the beginners of
a war.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lest there should be some uneasiness in the minds of
candid men as to what is to be the course of the Government
toward the Southern States after the rebellion shall have been
suppressed, the Executive deems it proper to say it will be his
purpose then, as ever, to be guided by the Constitution and the
laws, and that he probably will have no different understanding
of the powers and duties of the Federal Government relatively
to the rights of the United States and the people under
the Constitution than that expressed in the Inaugural Address.
He desires to preserve the Government that it may be administered
for all, as it was administered by the men who made
it. Loyal citizens everywhere have a right to claim this of
their Government, and the Government has no right to withhold
or neglect it. It is not perceived that in giving it there
is any coercion, conquest or subjugation in any sense of these
terms.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Constitution provided, and all the States have accepted
the provision, &#8216;that the United States shall guarantee
to every State in this Union a Republican form of government,&#8217;
but if a State may lawfully go out of the Union,
having done so, it may also discard the Republican form of
Government. So that to prevent its going out is an indispensable
means to the end of maintaining the guaranty mentioned;
and when an end is lawful and obligatory, the indispensable
means to it are also lawful and obligatory.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was with the deepest regret that the Executive found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
the duty of employing the war power. In defence of the
Government forced upon him, he could but perform this duty
or surrender the existence of the Government. No compromise
by public servants could in this case be a cure, not
that compromises are not often proper, but that no popular
government can long survive a marked precedent, that those
who carry an election can only save the Government from
immediate destruction by giving up the main point upon
which the people gave the election. The people themselves
and not their servants can safely reverse their own deliberate
decisions.</p>

<p>&#8220;As a private citizen the Executive could not have consented
that these institutions shall perish, much less could he,
in betrayal of so vast and so sacred a trust as these free
people had confided to him. He felt that he had no moral
right to shrink, nor even to count the chances of his own life
in what might follow.</p>

<p>&#8220;In full view of his great responsibility, he has so far done
what he has deemed his duty. You will now, according to
your own judgment, perform yours. He sincerely hopes that
your views and your actions may so accord with his as to assure
all faithful citizens who have been disturbed in their
rights, of a certain and speedy restoration to them, under the
Constitution and laws; and having thus chosen our cause
without guile, and with pure purpose, let us renew our trust
in God, and go forward without fear and with manly hearts.</p>

<p>&#8220;July 4, 1861.      <span class="right"><span class="smcap">Abraham Lincoln.</span>&#8221;</span><br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>This document, it will be observed, sets forth in temperate
language the facts bearing upon the rebellion in its then
stage&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;facts so stated that the common people could readily
comprehend the exact situation of affairs. Such a message,
always in place, was never more needed than at a juncture
when&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;as seemed not altogether impossible to many&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;an
appeal might yet have to be made again and again to the
great mass of the people for men and money to maintain the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
unity of the nation. It may be safely asserted, that the messages
of none of our Presidents have been so generally read
and so thoroughly mastered by the average mind, as those of
Mr. Lincoln, himself the tribune of the people.</p>

<p>Congress granted five hundred millions in money, and
directed a call for five hundred thousand volunteers for the
army; made provisions for a popular national loan; revised
the tariff; passed a direct tax bill; adopted measures, moderate
in their scope, for the confiscation of rebel property;
legalized the official acts of the President during the emergency
in which the country had been placed; and the House
of Representatives, with but two dissentients, passed the following
resolution:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<i>Resolved, By the House of Representatives of the Congress
of the United States</i>, That the present deplorable civil
war has been forced upon the country by the disunionists of
the Southern States, now in revolt against the Constitutional
Government, and in arms around the capital; that in this
national emergency Congress, banishing all feeling of mere
passion or resentment, will recollect only its duty to the
whole country; that this war is not waged on our part in any
spirit of oppression, nor for any purpose of conquest or subjugation,
nor purpose of authorizing or interfering with the
rights or established institutions of the States, but to defend
and maintain the supremacy of the Constitution, and to
preserve the Union, with all the dignities, equality, and
rights of the several States unimpaired, and that as soon as
these objects are accomplished the war ought to cease.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>On the 21st of July, the Army of the Union, under the
direct command of General McDowell, and the general supervision
of the veteran Scott&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;from whose onward movement
against the rebels in Virginia so much had been expected&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;met
with a serious reverse at Bull Run. They went forth,
exulting in victory as certain; they came back a panic-stricken
mob. For an instant, despondency took possession of every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
loyal heart; all manner of vague fears seized the people;
Washington would be captured; the cause was lost.</p>

<p>It was but for an instant, however. The rebound came.
Washington which might easily have been captured and
sacked, had the rebels known how to improve their success,
was securely fortified and amply garrisoned. One did not
then comprehend what now the most concede&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;that Bull Run
was a necessary discipline&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;a school in which all learned
somewhat&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;though, unfortunately, not all of us as much as we
should. That came later.</p>

Potomac.</p></blockquote>

<p>The victory of the conspirators at Bull Run, as was to have
been expected, elated them no little. Their President in his
message was supercilious and confident. Lauding the prowess
and determination of his confederates, he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;To speak of subjugating such a people, so united and
determined, is to speak in a language incomprehensible to
them: to resist attack on their rights or their liberties is with
them an instinct. Whether this war shall last one, or three,
or five years, is a problem they leave to be solved by the
enemy alone. It will last till the enemy shall have withdrawn
from their borders; till their political rights, their
altars, and their homes are freed from invasion. Then, and
then only, will they rest from this struggle to enjoy in peace,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
the blessings which, with the favor of Providence, they have
secured by the aid of their own strong hearts and steady arms.&#8221;</p>

<p>On the 25th of July, a new commander was assigned to the
Army of the Potomac, upon the warm recommendation of
Gen. Scott; George B. McClellan, who had already become
favorably known from his conducting a successful campaign
in Western Virginia. With the extravagance so characteristic
of the American people, this commander&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;whose laurels
were yet to be won&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;was hailed as a young Napoleon, lauded
to the skies, and failure under him regarded as an utter impossibility.</p>

<p>And the General betook himself to the organizing, disciplining,
and supplying his army, to which large accessions
were continually making from week to week.</p>

<p>On the 12th day of August was issued the following proclamation:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Whereas</span>, A joint committee of both Houses of Congress
has waited on the President of the United States, and requested
him to &#8216;recommend a day of public humiliation, prayer,
and fasting, to be observed by the people of the United States
with religious solemnities, and the offering of fervent supplications
to Almighty God for the safety and welfare of these
States, His blessings on their arms, and a speedy restoration
of peace.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">And whereas</span>, It is fit and becoming in all people, at all
times, to acknowledge and revere the Supreme Government
of God; to bow in humble submission to his chastisements;
to confess and deplore their sins and transgressions, in the
full conviction that the fear of the Lord is the beginning of
wisdom, and to pray, with all fervency and contrition, for the
pardon of their past offences, and for a blessing upon their
present and prospective action.</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">And whereas</span>, When our own beloved country, once, by
the blessing of God, united, prosperous, and happy, is now
afflicted with faction and civil war, it is peculiarly fit for us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
to recognize the hand of God in this terrible visitation, and,
in sorrowful remembrance of our own faults and crimes as a
nation, and as individuals, to humble ourselves before Him,
and to pray for His mercy&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;to pray that we may be spared
further punishment, though most justly deserved; that our
arms may be blessed and made effectual for the re-establishment
of law, order, and peace throughout the wide extent of
our country; and that the inestimable boon of civil and religious
liberty, earned under His guidance and blessing by the
labors and sufferings of our fathers, may be restored in all its
original excellence;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Therefore, I</i>, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United
States, do appoint the last Thursday in September next as a
day of humiliation, prayer, and fasting for all the people of
the nation. And I do earnestly recommend to all the people,
and especially to all ministers and teachers of religion, of all
denominations, and to all heads of families, to observe and
keep that day, according to their several creeds and modes of
worship, in all humility, and with all religious solemnity, to
the end that the united prayer of the nation may ascend to the
Throne of Grace, and bring down plentiful blessings upon our
country.</p>

<p>&#8220;In testimony whereof, I have hereunto set my hand, and
caused the seal of the United States to be affixed, this 12th

<p>And four days later the following:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Whereas</span>, On the 15th day of April, the President of the

conveying the same, or conveying persons to and from the
said States, with the said exceptions, will be forfeited to the
United States; and that, from and after fifteen days from the
issuing of this proclamation, all ships and vessels belonging,
in whole or in part, to any citizen or inhabitant of any of the
said States, with the said exceptions, found at sea in any part
of the United States, will be forfeited to the United States;
and I hereby enjoin upon all District Attorneys, Marshals,
and officers of the revenue of the military and naval forces of
the United States, to be vigilant in the execution of the said
act, and in the enforcement of the penalties and forfeitures
imposed or declared by it, leaving any party who may think
himself aggrieved thereby, to his application to the Secretary
of the Treasury for the remission of any penalty or forfeiture,
which the said Secretary is authorized by law to grant, if in
his judgment, the special circumstances of any case shall
require such a remission.</p>

<p>&#8220;In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand, and

<p>The question as to the disposition to be made of the slaves
of rebel masters presented itself early in the contest, and it
was at once perceived that its settlement would be attended
with no little embarrassment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
As early as May 27th, 1861, General Butler, in command
at Fortress Monroe, had informed the War Department as to
his views relative to the fugitive slaves&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;that they were to be
regarded as &#8220;contraband of war&#8221;&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;and Secretary Cameron,
under date of May 30th, had instructed that commander
neither to permit any interference by persons under his command
with the relations of persons held to service under the
laws of any State; nor, on the other hand, while such States
remained in rebellion, to surrender such persons to their
alleged masters, but to employ them in such service as would
be most advantageous, keeping an account of the value of
their labor and the expenses of their support&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;the question
of their final disposition to be reserved for future determination.</p>

<p>At about the same time, General McClellan, advancing into
Western Virginia to the aid of the loyal men of that section,
used this language in his address to the people:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;Notwithstanding all that has been said by the traitors to
induce you to believe that our advent among you will be
signalized by interference with your slaves, understand one
thing clearly&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;not only will we abstain from all such interference,
but we will, on the contrary, with an iron hand,
crush any attempt at insurrection on their part.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>On the 8th of August, Secretary Cameron, in reply to a
second letter from General Butler upon the same subject,
said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">General</span>:&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;The important question of the proper disposition
to be made of fugitives from service in the States in insurrection
against the Federal Government, to which you have
again directed my attention, in your letter of July 20th, has
received my most attentive consideration. It is the desire
of the President that all existing rights in all the States be
fully respected and maintained. The war now prosecuted on
the part of the Federal Government is a war for the Union,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
for the preservation of all the Constitutional rights of the
States and the citizens of the States in the Union; hence no
question can arise as to fugitives from service within the
States and Territories in which the authority of the Union is
fully acknowledged. The ordinary forms of judicial proceedings
must be respected by the military and civil authorities
alike for the enforcement of legal forms. But in the States
wholly or in part under insurrectionary control, where the
laws of the United States are so far opposed and resisted that
they can not be effectually enforced, it is obvious that the
rights dependent upon the execution of these laws must
temporarily fail, and it is equally obvious that the rights
dependent on the laws of the States within which military
operations are conducted must necessarily be subordinate to
the military exigencies created by the insurrection, if not
wholly forfeited by the treasonable conduct of the parties
claiming them. To this the general rule of the right to
service forms an exception. The act of Congress approved
August 6, 1861, declares that if persons held to service shall
be employed in hostility to the United States, the right to
their services shall be discharged therefrom. It follows of
necessity that no claim can be recognized by the military
authority of the Union to the services of such persons when
fugitives.</p>

<p>&#8220;A more difficult question is presented in respect to persons
escaping from the service of loyal masters. It is quite
apparent that the laws of the State under which only the
service of such fugitives can be claimed must needs be wholly
or almost wholly superseded, as to the remedies, by the
insurrection and the military measures necessitated by it;
and it is equally apparent that the substitution of military for
judicial measures for the enforcement of such claims must be
attended by great inconvenience, embarrassments and injuries.
Under these circumstances, it seems quite clear that the substantial
rights of loyal masters are still best protected by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
receiving such fugitives, as well as fugitives from disloyal
masters, into the service of the United States, and employing
them under such organizations and in such occupations as
circumstances may suggest or require. Of course a record
should be kept showing the names and descriptions of the
fugitives, the names and characters, as loyal or disloyal, of
their masters, and such facts as may be necessary to a correct
understanding of the circumstances of each case.</p>

<p>&#8220;After tranquility shall have been restored upon the return
of peace, Congress will doubtless properly provide for all the
persons thus received into the service of the Union, and for a
just compensation to loyal masters. In this way only, it
would seem, can the duty and safety of the Government and
just rights of all be fully reconciled and harmonized. You
will, therefore, consider yourself instructed to govern your
future action in respect to fugitives from service by the
premises herein stated, and will report from time to time, and
at least twice in each month, your action in the premises to
this Department. You will, however, neither authorize nor
permit any interference by the troops under your command
with the servants of peaceable citizens in a house or field, nor
will you in any manner encourage such citizens to leave the
lawful service of their masters, nor will you, except in cases
where the public good may seem to require it, prevent the
voluntary return of any fugitive to the service from which he
may have escaped.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>The Act of Congress to which allusion has already been
made, as providing for the confiscation of the estates of
persons in open rebellion against the Government, limited the
penalty to property actually employed in the service of the
rebellion, with the knowledge and consent of its owners; and,
instead of emancipating slaves thus employed, left the disposition
to be made of them to be determined by the United
States Courts, or by subsequent legislation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
General Fremont, in command of the Department of
Missouri, in an order dated August 30th, declaring martial
law established throughout that State, used the following
language:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;Real and personal property of those who shall take
up arms against the United States, or who shall be directly
proven to have taken an active part with their enemies in the
field, is declared confiscated to public use, and their slaves
if any they have, are hereby declared free men.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>This order violated the above-named act, and could only be
justified upon the ground of imperative military necessity.
Some correspondence which passed between the President
and General Fremont upon this topic, resulted in the following
official letter, dated Washington, D.&nbsp;C., Sept. 11,
1861:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">
&#8220;<span class="smcap">Major General John C. Fremont</span>:&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;<br />
</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;Yours of the 8th, in answer to mine of the 2d
inst., is just received. Assured that you, upon the ground,
could better judge of the necessities of your position than I
could at this distance, on seeing your proclamation of August
30, I perceived no general objection to it; the particular
clause however, in relation to the confiscation of property
and the liberation of slaves, appeared to me to be objectionable
in its non-conformity to the Act of Congress passed the
6th of last August, upon the same subjects, and hence I
wrote you, expressing my wish that that clause should
be modified accordingly. Your answer just received expresses
the preference on your part that I should make an
open order for the modification, which I very cheerfully do.
It is, therefore, ordered that the said clause of the said proclamation
be so modified, held and construed, as to conform
with, and not to transcend the provisions on the same subject
contained in the Act of Congress entitled &#8216;An Act to confiscate
property used for insurrectionary purposes,&#8217; approved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
August 6, 1861, and that said Act be published at length
with this order.</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="l2">&#8220;Your obedient servant,</span><br />
&#8220;<span class="smcap">A. Lincoln</span>.&#8221;<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>In the instructions from the War Department to General
Sherman, in command of the land forces destined to operate
on the South Carolina coast, that commander was directed to
govern himself relative to this class of persons, by the principles
of the letters addressed to General Butler, exercising,
however, his own discretion as to special cases. If particular
circumstances seemed to require it, they were to be employed
in any capacity, with such organization in squads, companies,
or otherwise, as should be by him deemed most beneficial to
the service. This, however, not to mean a general arming
of them for military service. All loyal masters were to be
assured that Congress would provide just compensation
to them for any loss of the services of persons so employed.</p>

<p>This phase&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;varying and indefinite&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;at that time did that
question present, which was at a later period to take, under
the moulding hand of the President, body and form clearly
defined and unmistakable.</p>

<p>The battle of Ball&#8217;s Bluff&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;the first under the direction of
the new commander on the Potomac&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;fought October 21st
was but Bull Run repeated; happily, however, on a somewhat
smaller scale. A convenient scapegoat upon whom to
throw the responsibility&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;General Stone&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;was found, and the
indignation of the country was measurably, and for the time,
appeased.</p>

<p>Directly after this affair, the veteran Scott having asked to
be relieved from active service, his request was granted in
the following highly complimentary order:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sigright">

&#8220;<i>Executive Mansion, Washington</i>, Nov. 1, 1861.<br />
</p>

<p>&#8220;On the 1st day of November, A.&nbsp;D., 1861, upon his own
application to the President of the United States, Brevet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
Lieutenant-General Winfield Scott is ordered to be placed,
and hereby is placed, upon the list of retired officers of the
Army of the United States, without reduction in his current
pay, subsistence, or allowances.</p>

<p>&#8220;The American people will hear with sadness and deep
emotion that General Scott has withdrawn from the active
control of the army, while the President and the unanimous
Cabinet express their own and the nation&#8217;s sympathy in his
personal affliction, and their profound sense of the important
public services rendered by him to his country during his
long and brilliant career, among which will ever be gratefully
distinguished his faithful devotion to the Constitution, the
Union, and the flag, when assailed by a parricidal rebellion.</p>

<p class="sigright">
&#8220;<span class="smcap">Abraham Lincoln.</span>&#8221;<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>To General McClellan, now the ranking officer of the army,
the duties of General-in-chief were assigned by the President.</p>

<p>The autumnal months passed away&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;gorgeous and golden&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;men
thought them made for fighting, if fighting must be;
but no fighting for the Army of the Potomac&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;an occasional
skirmish only&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;mainly reviews.</p>

<p>The winter months came&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;the dry season had passed.
The Grand Army being now thoroughly organized, disciplined,
and equipped went&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;to fight?&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;no&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;into winter
quarters.</p>

<p>And the people, patient ever and forgiving, when inclination
impels, forgot Ball&#8217;s Bluff&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;forgot what they had hoped
for&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;trusted in the prudent caution of the general in command,
and waited for the springtide.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.</a><br />

<span class="subhead">THE CONGRESS OF 1861&ndash;2.</span></h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang">The Military Situation&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;Seizure of Mason and Slidell&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;Opposition to the Administration&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;President&#8217;s
Message&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;Financial Legislation&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;Committee on the Conduct of the War&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;Confiscation
Bill.</p></blockquote>

<p>At the time of the re-assembling of Congress, December
2d, 1861, the military situation was by no means as promising
as the liberal expenditure of money and the earnest efforts of
the Administration toward a vigorous prosecution of the war
might have led the people to expect. True, the National
Capitol had been protected, and Maryland, West Virginia,
Kentucky, and Missouri had not, as had been at various times
threatened, been brought in subjection to the rebels. Nothing
more, however&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;though this would have been judged no
little, had the people been less sanguine of great results immediately
at hand&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;than this had been accomplished in the
East; and in the West, large rebel forces threatened Kentucky
and Missouri, and the Mississippi river was in their possession
from its mouth to within a short distance of the mouth
of the Ohio.</p>

<p>The seizure of the emissaries, Mason and Slidell likewise&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;though
afterwards disposed of by the Government in such a
way as to secure the acquiescence of the nation&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;taken in
connection with the position assumed by the British Government&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;in
every way unpalatable to the mass of the people&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;seemed
likely to entangle us in foreign complications exceedingly
undesirable at that juncture. It was generally believed
that England and France, while neutral on the surface, were
in reality affording very material aid and comfort to the rebel
cause, our commercial interests being very seriously impaired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
by the construction which those powers saw fit to place upon
their duties as neutrals.</p>

<p>Efforts, moreover, were making to organize a formidable
party in antagonism to the Administration, comprising the
loose ends of every class of malcontents; those who had
always opposed the war, though for a time cowed down by
the outburst which followed the fall of Sumter; those who
were satisfied that no more progress had been made; those
who were inclined, constitutionally, to oppose any thing
which any Administration, under any circumstances, might
do; those who were beginning to tire of the war, and were
ready to patch matters up in any way, so only that it should
come to an end; and those who were on the alert for some
chance whereby to make capital, political or pecuniary, for
their own dear selves.</p>

<p>As a whole, affairs were by no means a cheering aspect at
the opening of this Session.</p>

<p>That the President was fully alive to the true state of the
case, the views announced in the following message clearly
show:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Fellow-citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives</span>:&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;In
the midst of unprecedented political troubles,
we have cause of great gratitude to God for unusual good
health and most abundant harvests.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will not be surprised to learn that, in the peculiar
exigences of the times, our intercourse with foreign nations
has been attended with profound solicitude, chiefly turning
upon our own domestic affairs.</p>

<p>&#8220;A disloyal portion of the American people have, during the
whole year, been engaged in an attempt to divide and destroy
the Union. A nation which endures factious domestic
division, is exposed to disrespect abroad; and one party,
if not both, is sure, sooner or later, to invoke foreign intervention.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nations thus tempted to interfere, are not always able to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
resist the counsels of seeming expediency and ungenerous ambition,
although measures adopted under such influences seldom
fail to be unfortunate and injurious to those adopting them.</p>

<p>&#8220;The disloyal citizens of the United States who have
offered the ruin of our country, in return for the aid and comfort
which they have invoked abroad, have received less
patronage and encouragement than they probably expected.
If it were just to suppose, as the insurgents have seemed to
assume, that foreign nations, in this case, discarding all
moral, social and treaty obligations, would act solely, and
selfishly, for the most speedy restoration of commerce, including,
especially, the acquisition of cotton, those nations
appear, as yet, not to have seen their way to their objects
more directly, or clearly, through the destruction than
through the preservation of the Union. If we could dare to
believe that foreign nations are actuated by no higher principle
than this, I am quite sure a sound argument could be
made to show them that they can reach their aim more
readily and easily by aiding to crush this rebellion than by
giving encouragement to it.</p>

<p>&#8220;The principal lever relied on by the insurgents for exciting
foreign nations to hostility against us, as already intimated,
is the embarrassment of commerce. Those nations,
however, not improbably, saw from the first, that it was the
Union which made, as well our foreign, as our domestic commerce.
They can scarcely have failed to perceive that the
effort for disunion produces the existing difficulty; and that
one strong nation promises more durable peace, and a more
extensive, valuable and reliable commerce, than can the same
nation broken into hostile fragments.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not my purpose to review our discussions with
foreign States; because whatever might be their wishes or
dispositions, the integrity of our country and the stability of
our Government mainly depend, not upon them, but on the
loyalty, virtue, patriotism and intelligence of the American<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
people. The correspondence itself, with the usual reservations,
is herewith submitted.</p>

<p>&#8220;I venture to hope it will appear that we have practiced
prudence and liberality toward foreign powers, averting
causes of irritation, and with firmness maintaining our own
rights and honor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Since, however, it is apparent that here, as in every other
State, foreign dangers necessarily attend domestic difficulties,
I recommend that adequate and ample measures be adopted
for maintaining the public defences on every side. While,
under this general recommendation, provision for defending
our sea-coast line readily occurs to the mind, I also, in the
same connection, ask the attention of Congress to our great
lakes and rivers. It is believed that some fortifications and
depots of arms and munitions, with harbor and navigation
improvements, all at well-selected points upon these, would
be of great importance to the National defence and preservation.
I ask attention to the views of the Secretary of War,
expressed in his report, upon the same general subject.</p>

<p>&#8220;I deem it of importance that the loyal regions of East
Tennessee and Western North Carolina should be connected
with Kentucky, and other faithful parts of the Union, by
railroad. I therefore recommend, as a military measure, that
Congress provide for the construction of such road as speedily
as possible. Kentucky, no doubt, will co-operate, and,
through her Legislature, make the most judicious selection
of a line. The northern terminus must connect with some
existing railroad; and whether the route shall be from Lexington
or Nicholasville to the Cumberland Gap, or from
Lebanon to the Tennessee line, in the direction of Knoxville,
or on some still different line, can easily be determined.
Kentucky and the General Government coöperating, the
work can be completed in a very short time; and when done,
it will be not only of vast present usefulness, but also a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
valuable permanent improvement, worth its cost in all the
future.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some treaties, designed chiefly for the interests of commerce,
and having no grave political importance, have been
negotiated, and will be submitted to the Senate for their consideration.</p>

<p>&#8220;Although we have failed to induce some of the commercial
powers to adopt a desirable amelioration of the rigor of maritime
war, we have removed all obstructions from the way of
this humane reform, except such as are merely of temporary
and accidental occurrence.</p>

<p>&#8220;I invite your attention to the correspondence between
Her Britannic Majesty&#8217;s Minister, accredited to this Government,
and the Secretary of State, relative to the detention of
the British ship Perthshire, in June last, by the United States
steamer Massachusetts, for a supposed breach of the blockade.
As this detention was occasioned by an obvious misapprehension
of the facts, and as justice requires that we should commit
no belligerent act not founded in strict right, as sanctioned
by public law, I recommend that an appropriation be
made to satisfy the reasonable demand of the owners of the
vessel for her detention.</p>

<p>&#8220;I repeat the recommendation of my predecessor, in his
annual message to Congress in December last, in regard to
the disposition of the surplus which will probably remain
after satisfying the claims of the American citizens against
China, pursuant to the awards of the commissioners under
the act of the 3d of March, 1859. If, however, it should
not be deemed advisable to carry that recommendation into
effect, I would suggest that authority be given for investing
the principal, over the proceeds of the surplus referred to, in
good securities, with a view to the satisfaction of such other
just claims of our citizens against China as are not unlikely
to arise hereafter in the course of our extensive trade with
that empire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
&#8220;By the act of the 5th of August last, Congress authorized
the President to instruct the commanders of suitable vessels
to defend themselves against and to capture pirates. This
authority has been exercised in a single instance only. For
the more effectual protection of our extensive and valuable
commerce, in the Eastern seas especially, it seems to me that
it would also be advisable to authorize the commanders of
sailing vessels to recapture any prizes which pirates may
make of United States vessels and their cargoes, and the
consular courts, now established by law in Eastern countries,
to adjudicate the cases, in the event that this should not be
objected to by the local authorities.</p>

<p>&#8220;If any good reason exists why we should persevere longer
in withholding our recognition of the independence and sovereignty
of Hayti and Liberia, I am unable to discern it.
Unwilling, however, to inaugurate a novel policy in regard
to them without the approbation of Congress, I submit for
your consideration the expediency of an appropriation for
maintaining a charge d&#8217;affaires near each of those new States.
It does not admit of doubt that important commercial advantages
might be secured by favorable treaties with them.</p>

<p>&#8220;The operations of the treasury during the period which
has elapsed since your adjournment, have been conducted
with signal success. The patriotism of the people has
placed at the disposal of the Government the large means
demanded by the public exigencies. Much of the national
loan has been taken by citizens of the industrial classes,
whose confidence in their country&#8217;s faith, and zeal for their
country&#8217;s deliverance from present peril, have induced them
to contribute to the support of the Government the whole of
their limited acquisitions. This fact imposes peculiar obligations
to economy in disbursement, and energy in action.</p>

<p>&#8220;The revenue from all sources, including loans, for the
financial year ending on the 30th of June, 1861, was eighty-six
million eight hundred and thirty-five thousand nine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
hundred dollars and twenty-seven cents, and the expenditures
for the same period, including payments on account of the
public debt, were eighty-four million five hundred and seventy-eight
thousand eight hundred and thirty-four dollars and
forty-seven cents; leaving a balance in the treasury on the
1st of July of two million two hundred and fifty-seven
thousand sixty-five dollars and eighty cents. For the first
quarter of the financial year, ending on the 30th of September,
1861, the receipts from all sources, including the balance
of the 1st of July, were one hundred and two million five
hundred and thirty-two thousand five hundred and nine
dollars and twenty-seven cents, and the expenses ninety-eight
million two hundred and thirty-nine thousand seven
hundred and thirty-three dollars and nine cents; leaving a
balance on the 1st of October, 1861, of four million two hundred
and ninety-two thousand seven hundred and seventy-six
dollars and eighteen cents.</p>

<p>&#8220;Estimates for the remaining three-quarters of the year,
and for the financial year 1863, together with his views of
ways and means for meeting the demands contemplated by
them, will be submitted to Congress by the Secretary of the
Treasury. It is gratifying to know that the expenditures
made necessary by the rebellion are not beyond the resources
of the loyal people, and to believe that the same patriotism
which has thus far sustained the Government will continue
to sustain it till peace and Union shall again bless the land.</p>

<p>&#8220;I respectfully refer to the report of the Secretary of War
for information respecting the numerical strength of the
Army, and for recommendations having in view an increase
of its efficiency and the well-being of the various branches
of the service intrusted to his care. It is gratifying to know
that the patriotism of the people has proved equal to the
occasion, and that the number of troops tendered greatly
exceeds the force which Congress authorized me to call into
the field.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
&#8220;I refer with pleasure to those portions of his report which
make allusion to the creditable degree of discipline already
attained by our troops, and to the excellent sanitary condition
of the entire army.</p>

<p>&#8220;The recommendation of the Secretary for an organization
of the militia upon a uniform basis is a subject of vital importance
to the future safety of the country, and is commended
to the serious attention of Congress.</p>

<p>&#8220;The large addition to the regular army, in connection
with the defection that has so considerably diminished the
number of its officers, gives peculiar importance to his recommendation
for increasing the corps of cadets to the greatest
capacity of the Military Academy.</p>

<p>&#8220;By mere omission, I presume, Congress has failed to provide
chaplains for hospitals occupied by volunteers. This
subject was brought to my notice, and I was induced to draw
up the form of a letter, one copy of which, properly addressed,
has been delivered to each of the persons, and at the dates
respectively named and stated, in a schedule, containing also
the form of the letter, marked A, and herewith transmitted.</p>

<p>&#8220;These gentlemen, I understand, entered upon the duties
designated, at the times respectively stated in the schedule,
and have labored faithfully therein ever since. I therefore
recommend that they be compensated at the same rate as
chaplains in the army. I further suggest that general provision
be made for chaplains to serve at hospitals, as well as
with regiments.</p>

<p>&#8220;The report of the Secretary of the Navy presents in detail
the operations of that branch of the service, the activity and
energy which have characterized its administration, and the
results of measures to increase its efficiency and power. Such
have been the additions, by construction and purchase, that it
may almost be said a navy has been created and brought into
service since our difficulties commenced.</p>

<p>&#8220;Besides blockading our extensive coast, squadrons larger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
than ever before assembled under our flag have been put
afloat, and performed deeds which have increased our naval
renown.</p>

<p>&#8220;I would invite special attention to the recommendation
of the Secretary for a more perfect organization of the Navy
by introducing additional grades in the service.</p>

<p>&#8220;The present organization is defective and unsatisfactory,
and the suggestions submitted by the Department will, it is
believed, if adopted, obviate the difficulties alluded to promote
harmony, and increase the efficiency of the Navy.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are three vacancies on the bench of the Supreme
Court&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;two by the decease of Justices Daniel and McLean,
and one by the resignation of Justice Campbell. I have so
far forborne making nominations to fill these vacancies for
reasons which I will now state. Two of the outgoing judges
resided within the States now overrun by revolt; so that if
successors were appointed in the same localities, they could
not now serve upon their circuits; and many of the most
competent men there probably would not take the personal
hazard of accepting to serve, even here, upon the Supreme
Bench. I have been unwilling to throw all the appointments
northward, thus disabling myself from doing justice to the
South on the return of peace; although I may remark that
to transfer to the North one which has heretofore been in the
South would not, with reference to territory and population,
be unjust.</p>

<p>&#8220;During the long and brilliant judicial career of Judge
McLean, his circuit grew into an empire&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;altogether too large
for any one judge to give the courts therein more than a
nominal attendance&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;rising in population from one million
four hundred and seventy thousand and eighteen, in 1830, to
six million one hundred and fifty-one thousand four hundred
and five, in 1860.</p>

<p>&#8220;Besides this, the country generally has outgrown our
present judicial system. If uniformity was at all intended,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
the system requires that all the States shall be accommodated
with circuit courts, attended by supreme judges, while, in
fact, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, Kansas, Florida, Texas,
California, and Oregon, have never had any such courts.
Nor can this well be remedied without a change in the
system; because the adding of judges to the Supreme Court,
enough for the accommodation of all parts of the country,
with circuit courts, would create a court altogether too numerous
for a judicial body of any sort. And the evil, if it
be one, will increase as new States come into the Union.
Circuit courts are useful, or they are not useful; if useful,
no State should be denied them; if not useful, no State
should have them. Let them be provided for all, or abolished
as to all.</p>

<p>&#8220;Three modifications occur to me, either of which, I think,
would be an improvement upon our present system. Let the
Supreme Court be of convenient number in every event.
Then, first, let the whole country be divided into circuits of
convenient size, the supreme judges to serve in a number of
them corresponding to their own number, and independent
circuit judges be provided for all the rest. Or, secondly, let
the supreme judges be relieved from circuit duties, and circuit
judges provided for all the circuits. Or, thirdly, dispense
with circuit courts altogether, leaving the judicial functions
wholly to the district courts, and an independent Supreme
Court.</p>

<p>&#8220;I respectfully recommend to the consideration of Congress
the present condition of the statute laws, with the hope that
Congress will be able to find an easy remedy for many of the
inconveniences and evils which constantly embarrass those
engaged in the practical administration of them. Since the
organization of the Government, Congress has enacted some
five thousand acts and joint resolutions, which fill more than
six thousand closely printed pages, and are scattered through
many volumes. Many of these acts have been drawn in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
haste and without sufficient caution, so that their provisions
are often obscure in themselves, or in conflict with each other,
or at least so doubtful as to render it very difficult for even
the best informed persons to ascertain precisely what the
statute law really is.</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems to me very important that the statute laws
should be made as plain and intelligible as possible, and be
reduced to as small a compass as may consist with the fulness
and precision of the will of the legislature and the perspicuity
of its language. This well done, would, I think,
greatly facilitate the labors of those whose duty it is to assist
in the administration of the laws, and would be a lasting
benefit to the people, by placing before them in a more accessible
and intelligible form, the laws which so deeply concern
their interests and their duties.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am informed by some whose opinions I respect, that all
the acts of Congress now in force, and of a permanent and
general nature, might be revised and re-written, so as to be
embraced in one volume (or at most, two volumes) of ordinary
and convenient size. And I respectfully recommend to
Congress to consider the subject, and, if my suggestion be
approved, to devise such plan as to their wisdom shall seem
most proper for the attainment of the end proposed.</p>

<p>&#8220;One of the unavoidable consequences of the present
insurrection, is the entire suppression, in many places, of all
the ordinary means of administering civil justice by the
officers and in the forms of existing law. This is the case, in
whole or in part, in all insurgent States; and as our armies
advance upon and take possession of parts of those States
the practical evil becomes more apparent. There are no
courts nor officers to whom the citizens of other States may
apply for the enforcement of their lawful claims against
citizens of the insurgent States; and there is a vast amount
of debt constituting such claims. Some have estimated it as
high as two hundred million dollars, due in large part, from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
insurgents in open rebellion to loyal citizens, who are even
now making great sacrifices in the discharge of their patriotic
duty, to support the Government.</p>

<p>&#8220;Under these circumstances, I have been urgently solicited
to establish by military power, courts to administer summary
justice in such cases. I have thus far declined to do it, not
because I had any doubt that the end proposed&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;the collection
of the debts&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;was just and right in itself, but because I
have been unwilling to go beyond the pressure of necessity
in the unusual exercise of power. But the powers of Congress,
I suppose, are equal to the anomalous occasion, and
therefore I refer the whole matter to Congress, with the hope
that a plan may be devised for the administration of justice
in all such parts of the insurgent States and Territories as
may be under the control of this Government, whether by a
voluntary return to allegiance and order, or by the power of
our arms. This, however, not to be a permanent institution,
but a temporary substitute, and to cease as soon as the ordinary
courts can be re-established in peace.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is important that some more convenient means should
be provided, if possible, for the adjustment of claims against
the Government, especially in view of their increased number
by reason of the war. It is as much the duty of Government
to render prompt justice against itself, in favor of citizens, as
it is to administer the same between private individuals. The
investigation and adjudication of claims, in their nature, belong
to the judicial department; besides, it is apparent that
the attention of Congress will be more than usually engaged
for some time to come with great national questions. It was
intended, by the organization of the Court of Claims, mainly
to remove this branch of business from the halls of Congress;
but while the court has proved to be an effective and valuable
means of investigation, it in a great degree fails to effect the
object of its creation for want of power to make its judgments
final.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
&#8220;Fully aware of the delicacy, not to say the danger, of the
subject, I commend to your careful consideration whether this
power of making judgments final may not properly be given
to the court, reserving the right of appeal on questions of law
to the Supreme Court, with such other provisions as experience
may have shown to be necessary.</p>

<p>&#8220;I ask attention to the report of the Postmaster General,
the following being a summary statement of the condition of
the department:</p>

<p>&#8220;The revenue from all sources during the fiscal year ending
June 30th, 1861, including the annual permanent appropriation
of seven hundred thousand dollars for the transportation
of &#8216;free mail matter,&#8217; was nine million forty-nine thousand
two hundred and ninety-six dollars and forty cents, being
about two per cent. less than the revenue for 1860.</p>

<p>&#8220;The expenditures were thirteen million six hundred and
six thousand seven hundred and fifty-nine dollars and eleven
cents, showing a decrease of more than eight per cent. as
compared with those of the previous year, and leaving an
excess of expenditure over the revenue for the last fiscal year
of four million five hundred and fifty-seven thousand four
hundred and sixty-two dollars and seventy-one cents.</p>

<p>&#8220;The gross revenue for the year ending June 30th, 1863,
is estimated at an increase of four per cent. on that of 1861,
making eight million six hundred and eighty-three thousand
dollars, to which should be added the earnings of the department
in carrying free matter, viz: seven hundred thousand
dollars, making nine million three hundred and eighty-three
thousand dollars.</p>

<p>&#8220;The total expenditures for 1863 are estimated at twelve
million five hundred and twenty-eight thousand dollars, leaving
an estimated deficiency of three million one hundred and
forty-five thousand dollars to be supplied from the treasury,
in addition to the permanent appropriation.</p>

<p>&#8220;The present insurrection shows, I think, that the extension<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
of this District across the Potomac river, at the time of establishing
the capital here, was eminently wise, and consequently
that the relinquishment of that portion of it which lies within
the State of Virginia was unwise and dangerous. I submit
for your consideration the expediency of regaining that part
of the District, and the restoration of the original boundaries
thereof, through negotiations with the state of Virginia.</p>

<p>&#8220;The report of the Secretary of the Interior, with the accompanying
documents, exhibits the condition of the several
branches of the public business pertaining to that department.
The depressing influences of the insurrection have been
specially felt in the operations of the Patent and General
Land Offices. The cash receipts from the sales of public
lands during the past year have exceeded the expenses of our
land system only about two hundred thousand dollars. The
sales have been entirely suspended in the Southern States,
while the interruptions to the business of the country, and
the diversions of large numbers of men from labor to military
service, have obstructed settlements in the new States and
Territories of the North-west.</p>

<p>&#8220;The receipts of the Patent Office have declined in nine
months about one hundred thousand dollars, rendering a large
reduction of the force employed necessary to make it self-sustaining.</p>

<p>&#8220;The demands upon the Pension Office will be largely increased
by the insurrection. Numerous applications for
pensions, based upon the casualties of the existing war, have
already been made. There is reason to believe that many who
are now upon the pension rolls, and in receipt of the bounty
of the Government, are in the ranks of the insurgent army, or
giving them aid and comfort. The Secretary of the Interior
has directed a suspension of the payment of the pensions of
such persons upon the proof of their disloyalty. I recommend
that Congress authorize that officer to cause the names of
such persons to be stricken from the pension rolls.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
&#8220;The relations of the Government with the Indian tribes
have been greatly disturbed by the insurrection, especially in
the Southern Superintendency and in that of New Mexico.
The Indian country south of Kansas is in the possession of
insurgents from Texas and Arkansas. The agents of the
United States appointed since the 4th of March for this superintendency
have been unable to reach their posts, while the
most of those who were in office before that time have espoused
the insurrectionary cause, and assume to exercise the
powers of agents by virtue of commissions from the insurrectionists.
It has been stated in the public press that a portion
of those Indians have been organized as a military force, and
are attached to the army of the insurgents. Although the
Government has no official information upon this subject,
letters have been written to the Commissioner of Indian
Affairs by several prominent chiefs, giving assurance of their
loyalty to the United States, and expressing a wish for the
presence of Federal troops to protect them. It is believed
that upon the repossession of the country by the Federal
forces the Indians will readily cease all hostile demonstrations,
and resume their former relations to the Government.</p>

<p>&#8220;Agriculture, confessedly the largest interest of the nation,
has not a department, nor a bureau, but a clerkship only,
assigned to it in the Government. While it is fortunate that
this great interest is so independent in its nature as to not
have demanded and extorted more from the Government, I
respectfully ask Congress to consider whether something
more can not be given voluntarily with general advantage.</p>

<p>&#8220;Annual reports exhibiting the condition of our agriculture,
commerce, and manufactures, would present a fund of information
of great practical value to the country. While I make
no suggestion as to details, I venture the opinion that an
agricultural and statistical bureau might profitably be organized.</p>

<p>&#8220;The execution of the laws for the suppression of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
African slave-trade has been confided to the Department of
the Interior. It is a subject of gratulation that the efforts
which have been made for the suppression of this inhuman
traffic have been recently attended with unusual success.
Five vessels being fitted out for the slave-trade have been
seized and condemned. Two mates of vessels engaged in the
trade, and one person in equipping a vessel as a slaver, have
been convicted and subjected to the penalty of fine and imprisonment,
and one captain, taken with a cargo of Africans
on board his vessel, has been convicted of the highest grade
of offence under our laws, the punishment of which is death.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Territories of Colorado, Dakota, and Nevada, created
by the last Congress, have been organized, and civil administration
has been inaugurated therein under auspices especially
gratifying, when it is considered that the leaven of treason
was found existing in some of these new countries when the
Federal officers arrived there.</p>

<p>&#8220;The abundant natural resources of these Territories, with
the security and protection afforded by organized government,
will doubtless invite to them a large immigration when peace
shall restore the business of the country to its accustomed
channels. I submit the resolutions of the Legislature of
Colorado, which evidence the patriotic spirit of the people of
the Territory. So far, the authority of the United States has
been upheld in all the Territories, as it is hoped it will be in
the future. I commend their interests and defence to the enlightened
and generous care of Congress.</p>

<p>&#8220;I recommend to the favorable consideration of Congress
the interests of the District of Columbia. The insurrection
has been the cause of much suffering and sacrifice to its inhabitants,
and as they have no representative in Congress,
that body should not overlook their just claims upon the
Government.</p>

<p>&#8220;At your late session a joint resolution was adopted authorizing
the President to take measures for facilitating a proper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
representation of the industrial interests of the United States
at the exhibition of the industry of all nations, to be holden in
London in the year 1862. I regret to say I have been
unable to give personal attention to this subject&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;a subject
at once so interesting in itself, and so extensively and intimately
connected with the material prosperity of the world.
Through the Secretaries of State and of the Interior a plan,
or system, has been devised, and partly matured, and which
will be laid before you.</p>

<p>&#8220;Under and by virtue of the act of Congress entitled &#8216;An
act to confiscate property used for insurrectionary purposes,&#8217;
approved August 6, 1861, the legal claims of certain persons
to the labor and service of certain other persons have become
forfeited; and numbers of the latter, thus liberated, are
already dependent on the United States, and must be provided
for in some way. Besides this, it is not impossible that some
of the States will pass similar enactments for their own benefit
respectively, and by operation of which persons of the
same class will be thrown upon them for disposal. In such
case I recommend that Congress provide for accepting such
persons from such States according to some mode of valuation,
in lieu, <i>pro tanto</i>, of direct taxes, or upon some other
plan to be agreed on with such States, respectively; that
such persons, on such acceptance by the General Government,
be at once deemed free; and, that, in any event, steps be
taken for colonizing both classes (or the one first mentioned,
if the other shall not be brought into existence) at some place
or places in a climate congenial to them. It might be well to
consider, too, whether the free colored people already in the
United States could not, so far as individuals may desire, be
included in such colonization.</p>

<p>&#8220;To carry out the plan of colonization may involve the
acquiring of territory, and also the appropriation of money
beyond that to be expended in the territorial acquisition.
Having practiced the acquisition of territory for nearly sixty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
years, the question of constitutional power to do so is no
longer an open one with us. The power was questioned at
first by Mr. Jefferson, who, however, in the purchase of
Louisiana, yielded his scruples on the plea of great expediency.
If it be said that the only legitimate object of acquiring
territory is to furnish homes for white men, this
measure effects that object, for the emigration of colored men
leaves additional room for white men remaining or coming
here. Mr. Jefferson, however, placed the importance of procuring
Louisiana more on political and commercial grounds
than on providing room for population.</p>

<p>&#8220;On this whole proposition, including the appropriation of
money with the acquisition of territory, does not the expediency
amount to absolute necessity&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;that without which the
Government itself cannot be perpetuated?</p>

<p>&#8220;The war continues. In considering the policy to be
adopted for suppressing the insurrection, I have been anxious
and careful that the inevitable conflict for this purpose shall
not degenerate into a violent and remorseless revolutionary
struggle. I have, therefore, in every case thought it proper
to keep the integrity of the Union prominent as the primary
object of the contest on our part, leaving all questions which
are not of vital military importance to the more deliberate
action of the legislature.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the exercise of my best discretion, I have adhered to
the blockade of the ports held by the insurgents, instead of
putting in force, by proclamation, the law of Congress
enacted at the late session for closing those ports.</p>

<p>&#8220;So, also, obeying the dictates of prudence, as well as the
obligations of law, instead of transcending, I have adhered to
the act of Congress to confiscate property used for insurrectionary
purposes. If a new law upon the same subject shall
be proposed, its propriety will be duly considered. The
Union must be preserved; and hence all indispensable means
must be employed. We should not be in haste to determine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
that radical and extreme measures, which may reach the loyal
as well as the disloyal, are indispensable.</p>

<p>&#8220;The inaugural address at the beginning of the administration,
and the message to Congress at the late special
session, were both mainly devoted to the domestic controversy
out of which the insurrection and consequent war have
sprung. Nothing now occurs to add or subtract to or from
the principles or general purposes stated and expressed in
those documents.</p>

<p>&#8220;The last ray of hope for preserving the Union peaceably
expired at the assault upon Fort Sumter; and a general
review of what has occurred since may not be unprofitable.
What was painfully uncertain then is much better defined and
more distinct now; and the progress of events is plainly in
the right direction. The insurgents confidently claimed a
strong support from north of Mason and Dixon&#8217;s line, and the
friends of the Union were not free from apprehension on the
point. This, however, was soon settled definitely, and on
the right side. South of the line, noble little Delaware led
off right from the first. Maryland was made to <i>seem</i> against
the Union. Our soldiers were assaulted, bridges were burned,
and railroads torn up within her limits, and we were many
days, at one time, without the ability to bring a single regiment
over her soil to the capital. Now her bridges and
railroads are repaired and open to the Government; she
already gives seven regiments to the cause of the Union and
none to the enemy; and her people, at a regular election,
have sustained the Union by a larger majority and a larger
aggregate vote than they ever before gave to any candidate
or any question. Kentucky, too, for some time in doubt, is
now decidedly, and, I think, unchangeably, ranged on the
side of the Union. Missouri is comparatively quiet, and I
believe can not again be overrun by the insurrectionists.
These three States of Maryland, Kentucky and Missouri,
neither of which would promise a single soldier at first, have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
now an aggregate of not less than forty thousand in the field
for the union; while of their citizens certainly not more than
a third of that number, and they of doubtful whereabouts and
doubtful existence, are in arms against it. After a somewhat
bloody struggle of months, winter closes on the Union
people of Western Virginia, leaving them masters of their
own country.</p>

<p>&#8220;An insurgent force of about fifteen hundred, for months
dominating the narrow peninsular region, constituting the
counties of Accomac and Northampton, and known as the
eastern shore of Virginia, together with some contiguous
parts of Maryland, have laid down their arms; and the people
there have renewed their allegiance to, and accepted the
protection of the old flag. This leaves no armed insurrectionist
north of the Potomac or east of the Chesapeake.</p>

<p>&#8220;Also we have obtained a footing at each of the isolated
points, on the southern coast, of Hatteras, Port Royal, Tybee
Island, near Savannah, and Ship Island; and we likewise
have some general accounts of popular movements, in behalf
of the Union, in North Carolina and Tennessee.</p>

<p>&#8220;These things demonstrate that the cause of the Union is
advancing steadily and certainly southward.</p>

<p>&#8220;Since your last adjournment, Lieut.-Gen. Scott has retired
from the head of the army. During his long life, the nation
has not been unmindful of his merit; yet, on calling to mind
how faithfully, ably and brilliantly he has served the country,
from a time far back in our history, when few of the now
living had been born, and thenceforward continually, I can
not but think we are still his debtors. I submit, therefore,
for your consideration, what further mark of recognition is
due to him, and to ourselves, as a grateful people.</p>

<p>&#8220;With the retirement of Gen. Scott came the Executive
duty of appointing, in his stead, a General-in-chief of the
army. It is a fortunate circumstance that neither in council
nor country was there, so far as I know, any difference of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
opinion as to the proper person to be selected. The retiring
chief repeatedly expressed his judgment in favor of Gen. McClellan
for the position, and in this the nation seemed to give
a unanimous concurrence. The designation of Gen. McClellan
is, therefore, in considerable degree, the selection of the
country as well as of the Executive; and hence there is better
reason to hope there will be given him the confidence and
cordial support thus, by fair implication, promised, and without
which he can not, with so full efficiency, serve the country.</p>

<p>&#8220;It has been said that one bad General is better than two
good ones; and the saying is true, if taken to mean no more
than that an army is better directed by a single mind, though
inferior, than by two superior ones at variance and cross-purposes
with each other.</p>

<p>&#8220;And the same is true in all joint operations wherein those
engaged <i>can</i> have none but a common end in view, and <i>can</i>
differ only as to the choice of means. In a storm at sea, no
one on board <i>can</i> wish the ship to sink, and yet, not unfrequently,
all go down together because too many will direct
and no single mind can be allowed to control.</p>

<p>&#8220;It continues to develop that the insurrection is largely, if
not exclusively, a war upon the first principle of popular government&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;the
rights of the people. Conclusive evidence of
this is found in the most grave and maturely-considered public
documents, as well as in the general tone of the insurgents.
In those documents we find the abridgment of the existing
right of suffrage and the denial to the people of all right to
participate in the selection of public officers, except the legislative,
boldly advocated, with labored arguments to prove that
large control of the people in government is the source of all
political evil. Monarchy itself is sometimes hinted at as a
possible refuge from the power of the people.</p>

<p>&#8220;In my present position I could scarcely be justified were I
to omit raising a warning voice against this approach of
returning despotism.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
&#8220;It is not needed nor fitting here that a general argument
should be made in favor of popular institutions; but there is
one point, with its connections, not so hackneyed as most
others, to which I ask a brief attention. It is the effort to
place <i>capital</i> on an equal footing with, if not above <i>labor</i>, in
the structure of government. It is assumed that labor is
available only in connection with capital&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;that nobody labors
unless somebody else, owning capital, somehow by the use of
it induces him to labor. This assumed, it is next considered
whether it is best that capital shall <i>hire</i> laborers, and thus
induce them to work by their own consent, or <i>buy</i> them,
and drive them to it without their consent. Having proceeded
so far, it is naturally concluded that all laborers are either
<i>hired</i> laborers, or what we call slaves. And further, it is
assumed that whoever is once a hired laborer is fixed in that
condition for life.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, there is no such relation between capital and labor as
assumed; nor is there any such thing as a free man being fixed
for life in the condition of a hired laborer. Both these assumptions
are false, and all inferences from them are groundless.</p>

<p>&#8220;Labor is prior to and independent of capital. Capital is
only the fruit of labor, and could never have existed if labor had
not first existed. Labor is the superior of capital, and deserves
much the higher consideration. Capital has its rights, which
are as worthy of protection as any other rights. Nor is it
denied that there is, and probably always will be, a relation
between labor and capital producing mutual benefits. The
error is in assuming that the whole labor of community exists
within that relation. A few men own capital, and that few
avoid labor themselves, and with their capital hire or buy
another few to labor for them. A large majority belong to
neither class&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;neither work for others nor have others working
for them. In most of the Southern States a majority of the
whole people, of all colors, are neither slaves nor masters,
while in the Northern a large majority are neither hirers nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
hired. Men, with their families&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;wives, sons, and daughters&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;work
for themselves, on their farms, in their houses, and in
their shops, taking the whole product to themselves, and asking
no favors of capital, on the one hand, nor of hired laborers or
slaves on the other. It is not forgotten that a considerable
number of persons mingle their own labor with capital&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;that
is, they labor with their own hands, and also buy or hire others
to labor for them; but this is only a mixed, and not a distinct
class. No principle stated is disturbed by the existence of this
mixed class.</p>

<p>&#8220;Again, as has already been said, there is not, of necessity,
any such thing as the free hired laborer being fixed to that
condition for life. Many independent men everywhere in these
States, a few years back in their lives, were hired laborers.
The prudent, penniless beginner in the world, labors for wages
awhile, saves a surplus with which to buy tools or land for himself,
then labors on his own account another while, and at length
hires another new beginner to help him. This is the just, and
generous, and prosperous system, which opens the way to all&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;gives
hope to all, and consequent energy, and progress, and
improvement of condition to all. No men living are more
worthy to be trusted than those who toil up from poverty;
none less inclined to take or touch aught which they have not
honestly earned. Let them beware of surrendering a political
power which they already possess, and which, if surrendered,
will surely be used to close the door of advancement against
such as they, and to fix new disabilities and burdens upon
them, till all of liberty shall be lost.</p>

<p>&#8220;From the first taking of our National Census to the last are
seventy years; and we find our population at the end of the
period eight times as great as it was at the beginning. The
increase of those other things which men deem desirable has
been even greater. We thus have at one view what the popular
principle, applied to Government through the machinery of
the States and the Union, has produced in a given time, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
also what if firmly maintained, it promises for the future.
There are already among us those who, if the Union be preserved,
will live to see it contain two hundred and fifty millions.
The struggle <i>of</i> to-day is not altogether <i>for</i> to-day; it is for a
vast future also. With a reliance on Providence all the more
firm and earnest, let us proceed in the great task which events
have devolved upon us.</p>

<p>At this session, provision was made for the issue of legal
tender notes, and an internal revenue bill was matured, for
the purposing of increasing largely the receipts of the Treasury,
affording a basis for the payment of interest on authorized
loans, and insuring confidence in the National currency.</p>

<p>A Congressional committee on the conduct of the war was
also appointed, the evidence obtained by which was submitted
to the President for his consideration and eventually given to

<p>A confiscation bill was passed, with a special provision for
conditional pardon and amnesty, limiting the forfeiture of real

<p>What was to be the final disposition of the question of
slavery could not be thrust aside. The intimate connection
of this institution with our military operations, was perpetually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
forcing it upon the attention of the nation. This subject had,
since it had been rendered patent to all, that it was to be no
holiday struggle in which we were engaged, but a life and
death grapple with desperate and determined foes, been ever
present to Mr. Lincoln&#8217;s mind. His action was, however, to
a certain extent, not suffered to be independent. Could he
have boldly assumed the initiative, assured that the great
mass of the people were at his back, he could have acted far
otherwise than he was necessitated to act, considering the
delicate nature of the question, the utter lack of precedents,
the intertwining of interests, the dangers resulting from
a single misstep, the divisions on this point, existing in the
ranks even of his own political supporters, and the conflicting
views held by men whose loyalty and devotion to the
country were unimpeachable.</p>

<p>He chose not to go far ahead of popular indications; he
deemed it the wiser statesmanship, in the existing state of
affairs, to keep in the lead but a little, feeling, so to speak,
his way along&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;making haste slowly. That this would dissatisfy
many of his political friends he well knew; but he,
upon mature deliberation, decided that it was for the interest
of the country, and that to that consideration everything else
must yield.</p>

<p>On the 6th of March, 1862, he sent to the Congress the following
message concerning this question, the resolution
embodied in which, was passed by both Houses:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives</span>:&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;I
recommend the adoption of a joint resolution
by your honorable bodies, which shall be substantially as
follows:</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Resolved</i>, That the United States ought to coöperate with
any State which may adopt gradual abolishment of slavery,
giving to such State pecuniary aid, to be used by such State
in its discretion, to compensate for the inconveniences, public
and private, produced by such change of system.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
&#8220;If the proposition contained in the resolution does not
meet the approval of Congress and the country, there is the
end; but if it does command such approval, I deem it of
importance that the States and people immediately interested,
should be at once distinctly notified of the fact, so that they
may begin to consider whether to accept or reject it. The
Federal Government would find its highest interest in such
a measure as one of the most efficient means of self-preservation.
The leaders of the existing insurrection entertain the
hope that this Government will ultimately be forced to
acknowledge the independence of some part of the disaffected
region, and that all the slave States north of such part will
then say, &#8216;the Union for which we have struggled being
already gone, we now choose to go with the southern
section.&#8217; To deprive them of this hope substantially ends the
rebellion, and the initiation of emancipation completely deprives
them of it as to all the States initiating it. The point
is not that <i>all</i> the States tolerating slavery would very soon,
if at all, initiate emancipation, but that, while the offer is
equally made to all, the more northern shall, by such initiation,
make it certain to the more southern that in no event
will the former ever join the latter in their proposed confederacy.
I say &#8216;initiation,&#8217; because in my judgment,
gradual, and not sudden emancipation, is better for all. In
the mere financial or pecuniary view, any member of Congress,
with the census tables and treasury reports before him, can
readily see for himself how very soon the current expenditures
of this war would purchase, at fair valuation, all the slaves
in any named State. Such a proposition on the part of the
general Government sets up no claim of a right by Federal
authority to interfere with slavery within State limits, referring,
as it does, the absolute control of the subject in each
case to the State and its people immediately interested. It
is proposed as a matter of perfectly free choice with them.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the annual message last December, I thought fit to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
say, &#8216;the Union must be preserved; and hence all indispensable
means must be employed.&#8217; I said this not hastily, but
deliberately. War has been made, and continues to be an
indispensable means to this end. A practical re-acknowledgment
of the national authority would render the war unnecessary,
and it would at once cease. If, however, resistance
continues, the war must also continue, and it is impossible to
foresee all the incidents which may attend, and all the ruin
which may follow it. Such as may seem indispensable, or
may obviously promise great efficiency toward ending the
struggle, must and will come.</p>

<p>&#8220;The proposition now made, though an offer only, I hope
it may be esteemed no offence to ask whether the pecuniary
consideration tendered would not be of more value to the
States and private persons concerned, than are the institutions
and property in it, in the present aspect of affairs.</p>

<p>&#8220;While it is true that the adoption of the proposed resolution
would be merely initiatory, and not within itself a practical
measure, it is recommended in the hope that it would
soon lead to important practical results. In full view of my
great responsibility to my God and to my country, I earnestly
beg the attention of Congress and the people to the
subject.</p>

<p>A bill abolishing slavery in the District of Columbia having
passed both Houses of Congress early in April, the President,
in communicating his approval of the measure, judged it
necessary to accompany the same with the following message:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives</span>:&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;The
act entitled &#8216;An act for the release of
certain persons held to service or labor in the District of
Columbia,&#8217; has this day been approved and signed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have never doubted the constitutional authority of Congress
to abolish slavery in this District, and I have ever desired
to see the National Capital freed from the institution in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
some satisfactory way. Hence there has never been, in my
mind, any question upon the subject except the one of expediency,
arising in view of all the circumstances. If there be
matters within and about this act which might have taken a
course or shape more satisfactory to my judgment, I do not
attempt to specify them. I am gratified that the two principles
of compensation and colonization are both recognized
and practically applied in the act.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the matter of compensation it is provided that claims
may be presented within ninety days from the passage of the
act, &#8216;but not thereafter,&#8217; and there is no saving for minors,
<i>femes-covert</i>, insane or absent persons. I presume this is
an omission by mere oversight, and I recommend that it be
supplied by an amendatory or supplemental act.</p>

<p>
&#8220;April 16, 1862.       <span class="right"><span class="smcap">Abraham Lincoln.</span>&#8221;</span><br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>The President&#8217;s repudiation, by the following proclamation,
of an emancipation order of General Hunter, was conclusive
evidence that he was determined to keep the control of this
vexed question in his own hands, and to suffer no military
commander to exercise jurisdiction over it:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Whereas</span>, There appears in the public prints what purports
to be a proclamation of Major-General Hunter, in the
words and figures following, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sigright">

&#8216;Head-Quarters, Department of the South,<br />

<span class="l2">&#8216;<i>Hilton Head, S. C.</i>, May 9th, 1862.</span></p>

<p>&#8216;The three States of Georgia, Florida, and South Carolina,
comprising the Military Department of the South, having
deliberately declared themselves no longer under the protection
of the United States of America, and having taken up
arms against the said United States, it becomes a military
necessity to declare them under martial law. This was
accordingly done on the twenty-fifth day of April, 1862.
Slavery and martial law in a free country are altogether incompatible.
The persons in these three States, Georgia,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
Florida, and South Carolina, heretofore held as slaves, are
therefore declared forever free.</p>

</p></blockquote>

<p>&#8216;<span class="smcap">And Whereas</span>, The same is producing some excitement
and misunderstanding,</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Therefore</i>, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United
States, proclaim and declare that the government of the United
States had no knowledge or belief of an intention, on the part
of General Hunter, to issue such a proclamation, nor has it
yet any authentic information that the document is genuine;
and further, that neither General Hunter nor any other commander
or person has been authorized by the government of
the United States to make proclamation declaring the slaves
of any State free, and that the supposed proclamation now in
question, whether genuine or false, is altogether void, so far
as respects such declaration.</p>

<p>&#8220;I further make known, that whether it be competent for
me as commander-in-chief of the army and navy to declare
the slaves of any State or States free, and whether at any time,
or in any case, it shall become a necessity indispensable to the
maintenance of the Government to exercise such supposed
power, are questions which, under my responsibility, I reserve
to myself, and which I cannot feel justified in leaving to the
decision of commanders in the field. These are totally different
questions from those of police regulations in armies and
camps.</p>

<p>&#8220;On the sixth day of March last, by a special message, I
recommended to Congress the adoption of a joint resolution,
to be substantially as follows:</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Resolved</i>, That the United States ought to coöperate with
any State which may adopt a gradual abolishment of slavery,
giving to such State pecuniary aid, to be used by such State
in its discretion, to compensate for the inconveniences, public
and private, produced by such change of system.&#8217;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;The resolution, in the language above quoted, was adopted
by large majorities in both branches of Congress, and now
stands an authentic, definite and solemn proposal of the nation
to the States and people most immediately interested in the
subject matter. To the people of these States I now earnestly
appeal. I do not argue; I beseech you to make the arguments
for yourselves. You cannot, if you would, be blind to
the signs of the times. I beg of you a calm and enlarged consideration
of them, ranging, if it may be, far above personal
and partisan politics. This proposal makes common cause
for a common object, casting no reproaches upon any. It acts
not the Pharisee. The change it contemplates would come
gently as the dews of Heaven, not rending or wrecking any
thing. Will you not embrace it? So much good has not
been done by one effort in all past time, as in the Providence
of God it is now your high privilege to do. May the vast
future not have to lament that you have neglected it.</p>

<p>&#8220;In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand, and
caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Done at the City of Washington, this nineteenth day of
May, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred
and sixty-two, and of the Independence of the United States
the eighty-sixth.</p>

</p></blockquote>

<p>A short time before the adjournment of Congress, while the
country was in a state of great despondency, owing to the
miscarriage of the Peninsular Campaign, the President,
knowing that whatever measures events should point out as
necessary to put down the rebellion must be adopted, and
anticipating that a blow directed at the institution of slavery
would, probably, at no distant period have to be dealt, invited
the Senators and Representatives of the Border Slave
States to a conference, for the purpose of preparing their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
minds for the happening of such a contingency. On this occasion
he read to them the following carefully prepared
address, to which he received an approving response from but
nine of the twenty-nine:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>:&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;After the adjournment of Congress, now
near, I shall have no opportunity of seeing you for
several months. Believing that you of the Border States
held more power for good than any other equal number of
members, I feel it a duty which I can not justifiably waive to
make this appeal to you.</p>

<p>&#8220;I intend no reproach or complaint when I assure you that,
in my opinion, if you all had voted for the resolution in the
gradual emancipation message of last March, the war would
now be substantially ended. And the plan therein proposed
is yet one of the most potent and swift means of ending it.
Let the States which are in rebellion see definitely and certainly
that in no event will the States you represent ever join
their proposed Confederacy, and they can not much longer
maintain the contest. But you can not divest them of their
hope to ultimately have you with them so long as you show
a determination to perpetuate the institution within your
own States. Beat them at elections, as you have overwhelmingly
done, and, nothing daunted, they still claim you
as their own. You and I know what the lever of their power
is. Break that lever before their faces, and they can shake
you no more forever.</p>

<p>&#8220;Most of you have treated me with kindness and consideration,
and I trust you will not now think I improperly touch
what is exclusively your own, when, for the sake of the whole
country, I ask, &#8216;Can you, for your States, do better than to
take the course I urge?&#8217; Discarding <i>punctilio</i> and maxims
adapted to more manageable times, and looking only to the
unprecedentedly stern facts of our case, can you do better in
any possible event? You prefer that the constitutional relations
of the States to the nation shall be practically restored<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
without disturbance of the institution; and, if this were done,
my whole duty in this respect, under the Constitution and my
oath of office, would be performed. But it is not done, and
we are trying to accomplish it by war. The incidents of the
war can not be avoided. If the war continues long, as it must
if the object be not sooner attained, the institution in your
States will be extinguished by mere friction and abrasion&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;by
the mere incidents of the war. It will be gone, and you
will have nothing valuable in lieu of it. Much of its value is
gone already. How much better for you and for your people
to take the step which at once shortens the war, and secures
substantial compensation for that which is sure to be wholly
lost in any other event! How much better to thus save the
money which else we sink forever in the war! How much
better to do it while we can, lest the war, ere long, render us
pecuniarily unable to do it! How much better for you, as
seller, and the nation, as buyer, to sell out and buy out that
without which the war could never have been, than to sink
both the thing to be sold and the price of it, in cutting one
another&#8217;s throats!</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not speak of emancipation at once, but of a decision
at once to emancipate gradually. Room in South America
for colonization can be obtained cheaply and in abundance,
and when numbers shall be large enough to be company and
encouragement for one another, the freed people will not be
so reluctant to go.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am pressed with a difficulty not yet mentioned&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;one
which threatens division among those who, united, are none
too strong. An instance of it is known to you. General
Hunter is an honest man. He was, and I hope still is, my
friend. I valued him none the less for his agreeing with me
in the general wish that all men everywhere could be freed.
He proclaimed all men free within certain States, and I repudiated
the proclamation. He expected more good and less
harm from the measure than I could believe would follow.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
Yet, in repudiating it, I gave dissatisfaction, if not offence, to
many whose support the country can not afford to lose. And
this is not the end of it. The pressure in this direction is still
upon me, and is increasing. By conceding what I now ask
you can relieve me, and, much more, can relieve the country
in this important point.</p>

<p>&#8220;Upon these considerations, I have again begged your
attention to the Message of March last. Before leaving the
Capitol, consider and discuss it among yourselves. You are
patriots and statesmen, and as such, I pray you consider this
proposition, and, at the least, commend it to the consideration
of your States and people. As you would perpetuate popular
government for the best people in the world, I beseech
you that you do in no wise omit this. Our common country
is in great peril, demanding the loftiest views and boldest
action to bring a speedy relief. Once relieved, its form of
government saved to the world, its beloved history and cherished
memories are vindicated, and its happy future fully
assured and rendered inconceivably grand. To you, more
than to any others, the privilege is given to assure that happiness,
and swell that grandeur, and to link your own names
therewith forever.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>On the twenty-second of July, the following order was

<p>Early in 1862 appeared the following:</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Ordered</span>, That the 22d day of February, 1862, be the day

<p>&#8220;That especially the Army at and about Fortress Monroe,

<p>&#8220;That all other forces, both land and naval, with their respective

be ready to obey additional orders when duly given.</p>

<p>&#8220;That the Heads of Departments, and especially the Secretaries

<p>In thus resuming whatever of his constitutional duties as
Commander-in-chief of the army and navy might have been
temporarily devolved upon others, and directing immediate
and energetic aggressive measures, the President only acted
as the exponent of the popular feeling, which had become
manifest, of dissatisfaction at the apparently inexcusable want
of action in military affairs.</p>

<p>In the West and South-west followed the successful battle
at Mill Spring, Kentucky; the capture of Forts Henry and
Donelson, compelling the evacuation of Nashville, and ridding
Kentucky of any organized rebel force; the hardly contested,
but successful battle of Pea Ridge, Arkansas, relieving Missouri,
in a great degree; victory for our arms wrested from
the jaws of defeat at Shiloh; and the occupation of New
Orleans, giving control of the Mouth of the Mississippi.</p>

<p>What at the East?&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;Roanoke Island.</p>

<p>Touching the movements of the Army of the Potomac, to
which the country looked so expectantly for grand results,
efficiently officered, thoroughly disciplined, and splendidly
equipped as it was known or supposed to be, the first difficulty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
was to fix upon a plan. For the purpose of leading
the attention of its General to something like a definite decision
however, the order of January 27th was succeeded by
the following:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sigright">

&#8220;<i>Executive Mansion, Washington</i>, January 31st, 1862.<br />

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Ordered</span>, That all the disposable force of the Army of the

be formed into an expedition for the immediate object of

be in the discretion of the Commander-in-chief, and the expedition
to move before, or on the twenty-second day of February
next.</p>

<p class="sigright">
&#8220;<span class="smcap">Abraham Lincoln.</span>&#8221;<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>General McClellan objecting to this movement and earnestly
urging a plan of advance upon Richmond by the Lower Rappahannock
with Urbana as a base, the President addressed
him the following letter:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sigright">

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">My Dear Sir</span>:&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;You and I have distinct and different

river; mine to move directly to a point on the railroad south-west
of Manassas.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you will give satisfactory answers to the following
questions, I shall gladly yield my plan to yours:</p>

<p>&#8220;First. Does not your plan involve a greatly larger expenditure
of <i>time</i> and <i>money</i> than mine?</p>

<p>&#8220;Second. Wherein is a victory <i>more certain</i> by your plan

</p></blockquote>

<p>Which plain, practical questions were never directly answered.</p>

<p>This army being without any organization into Army Corps,
the President, on the 8th of March, as a movement was about
to be made toward Manassas, issued a peremptory order to
the Commanding General to attend forthwith to such organization,
naming the Corps and their Commanders, according to
seniority of rank.</p>

<p>On the same day, the President, who had, against his own
judgment, yielded the plan for an advance upon Richmond
which should at the same time cover Washington, wise
through experience, issued the following:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sigright">
&#8220;<i>Executive Mansion, Washington</i>, March 8th, 1862.<br />
</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Ordered.</span> That no change of the base of operations of
the Army of the Potomac shall be made without leaving in
and about Washington such a force as, in the opinion of the
General-in-chief and the commanders of Army Corps, shall
leave said city entirely secure.</p>

<p>&#8220;That no more than two Army Corps (about fifty thousand
troops) of said Army of the Potomac shall be moved <i>en route</i>
for a new base of operations until the navigation of the
Potomac, from Washington to the Chesapeake Bay, shall be
freed from the enemy&#8217;s batteries, and other obstructions, or
until the President shall hereafter give express permission.</p>

<p>&#8220;That any movement as aforesaid, <i>en route</i> for a new base
of operations, which may be ordered by the General-in-chief,
and which may be intended to move upon Chesapeake Bay,
shall begin to move upon the bay as early as the 18th of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
March, instant, and the General-in-chief shall be responsible
that it moves as early as that day.</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Ordered</span>, That the Army and Navy coöperate in an
immediate effort to capture the enemy&#8217;s batteries upon the
Potomac between Washington and the Chesapeake Bay.</p>

<p class="sigright b0">
&#8220;<span class="smcap">Abraham Lincoln.</span><br />
</p>

<p class="p0">&#8220;<span class="smcap">L. Thomas</span>, Adjutant-General.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Finally&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;after delays manifold, correspondence voluminous,
discussions heated, and patience nearly worn threadbare&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;commenced
that military movement, which has passed into
history as the American Peninsular Campaign; by virtue of
which, commencing about the middle of March, 1862, a large
body of finely disciplined troops&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;their numbers varying,
according to various accounts, from one hundred thousand
nine hundred and seventy, to one hundred and twenty-one
thousand five hundred men&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;left Alexandria for Richmond,
<i>via</i> Yorktown, and succeeded, after sanguinary battles, swamp
sickness, severe exposures, and terrible hardships, in returning
(how many of them?) to Alexandria <i>via</i> Harrison&#8217;s
Landing, by about the middle of August, 1862.</p>

<p>That campaign was the most disastrous drawback of the
war, not merely in the loss of men, nor in the failure to reach
the end aimed at, but mainly in its enervating effect upon
the supporters of the Government. It was Bull Run over
again, only immensely magnified, indefinitely prolonged.
Fortune seemed determined never to favor our Eastern
braves.</p>

<p>Into the details of that campaign it is needless to enter
here. Every schoolboy knows them by heart, so far as they
are spread upon the record. Equally idle is it to attempt a
criticism upon the campaign in a military point of view.
That has been already done to a nauseating extent; yet will,
doubtless, continue to be done while the reader lives.</p>

<p>No details, nor military criticism therefore here. But that
President Lincoln may fairly be presented in his relations to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
this campaign, certain observations must be made. And this
is the place to make them.</p>

<p>Conceding to General McClellan all the ability, patriotism,
and bravery which have been claimed for him by his warmest
admirers, there still remain some unfortunate circumstances
connected with him, by reason of which&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;even though he,
personally, were responsible for no single one of them&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;not
all the ability, patriotism, and bravery of a Napoleon, Tell,
and Bayard combined, could have secured in his person what
this country needed for the rooting out of the great rebellion.</p>

<p>It was unfortunate for him that, at the very outset&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;when
so little was known of him, when he had done so little&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;sycophantic
flatterers should have exalted him at once into a
great military chieftain. Peculiarly unfortunate was this,
considering that the changeable American people were to
pass upon him and his actions&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;that people, in their relations
to their leading men, with their &#8220;Hosannas&#8221; to-day and their
&#8220;Crucify him&#8217;s&#8221; to-morrow. The sequel of &#8220;going up like a
rocket&#8221; is not generally supposed to be particularly agreeable.</p>

<p>It was unfortunate for him that the opinion obtained, in the
minds of many, impartial and competent to judge, that, in his
case, caution had passed the bounds of prudence and run
mad. There are emergencies when every thing must be
risked that nothing be lost.</p>

<p>It was unfortunate for him that he was made the especial
pet of those individuals who were most clamorous against an
Administration which, whatever its short comings, every
candid man knew was earnestly intent upon ending the war
upon such a basis as could alone, in its judgment, secure
permanent peace. If a subordinate general could not agree
with his superiors, or content himself with matters purely
military, he should have declined to remain in the service.</p>

<p>It was unfortunate for him that his especial friends sought,
in print, and public speech, and private conversation, to
create the impression that the President did not desire that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
he should succeed, owing to a fear that he might prove
a formidable competitor at the next Presidential election.
Peculiarly unfortunate, when one remembers that this President
had, at the outbreak of the war, put at the head of three
important military departments three of the most decided of
his political opponents&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;Patterson, Butler, and McClellan&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;that
no man ever occupied the Presidential chair, unless it be
its first occupant, who had less selfishness and more disinterestedness
in his composition than President Lincoln.</p>

<p>It was unfortunate for him that such desperate efforts
were made by his supporters to fasten the responsibility for
admitted failures upon other parties. This began at Ball&#8217;s
Bluff, as has already been noted. The Secretary of War was
dragged in, as well as the President, in connection with the
Peninsular Campaign. As to this last, nothing more to the
point can be adduced than the words of a man, whose honesty
and truthfulness were known wherever he was known&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;Abraham
Lincoln&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;in a characteristic speech made by him
at a Union meeting in Washington, August 6th, 1862, when
the issue of the campaign was certain:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Fellow-citizens</span>:&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;I believe there is no precedent for my
appearing before you on this occasion; but it is also true
that there is no precedent for your being here yourselves, and
I offer, in justification of myself and of you, that, upon examination,
I have found nothing in the Constitution against
it. I, however, have an impression that there are younger
gentlemen who will entertain you better, and better address
your understanding than I will or could, and therefore I propose
but to detain you a moment longer.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am very little inclined on any occasion to say any thing
unless I hope to produce some good by it. The only thing I
think of just now not likely to be better said by some one else
is a matter in which we have heard some other persons
blamed for what I did myself. There has been a very widespread
attempt to have a quarrel between General McClellan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
and the Secretary of War. Now, I occupy a position that
enables me to observe, that at least these two gentlemen are not
nearly so deep in the quarrel as some pretending to be their
friends. General McClellan&#8217;s attitude is such that, in the
very selfishness of his nature, he cannot but wish to be successful,
and I hope he will&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;and the Secretary of War is in
precisely the same situation. If the military commanders in
the field cannot be successful, not only the Secretary of War,
but myself, for the time being the master of them both, can
not be but failures. I know that General McClellan wishes
to be successful, and I know he does not wish it any more
than the Secretary of War for him, and both of them together
no more than I wish it. Sometimes we have a dispute about
how many men General McClellan has had, and those who
would disparage him say that he has had a very large number,
and those who would disparage the Secretary of War
insist that General McClellan has had a very small number.
The basis for this is, there is always a wide difference, and on
this occasion perhaps a wider one, between the grand total
on McClellan&#8217;s rolls and the men actually fit for duty; and
those who would disparage him talk of the grand total on
paper, and those who would disparage the Secretary of War
talk of those at present fit for duty. General McClellan has
sometimes asked for things that the Secretary of War did not
give him. General McClellan is not to blame for asking
what he wanted and needed, and the Secretary of War is
not to blame for not giving when he had none to give. And
I say here, as far as I know, the Secretary of War has withheld
no one thing at any time in my power to give him.
I have no accusation against him. I believe he is a brave
and able man, and I stand here, as justice requires me to do,
to take upon myself what has been charged on the Secretary
of War, as withholding from him. I have talked longer
than I expected to, and now I avail myself of my privilege
of saying no more.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
It was unfortunate for him that the precedents were so
numerous in American history for making a successful military
man President. This must have embarrassed him no
little, and tempted him into much of that correspondence
which otherwise he would have avoided. Had it not been
for these fatal precedents, he, assuredly, would not have
leisurely seated himself at Harrison&#8217;s Landing to write to the
President a lengthy homily on affairs of State at a moment
when it was doubtful whether he would long have an army
of which he could be General in command.</p>

<p>Finally, it was unfortunate for him that he had not, when
learning to command, learned also to obey. This would have
spared himself and the country and the cause several entirely
superfluous inflictions.</p>

<p>Whoever would form a correct estimate of President Lincoln&#8217;s
connection with the Peninsular campaign and its
commander, must bear these facts in mind. Aside from all
considerations of a purely military nature, they are indispensable
in reaching an unbiassed decision.</p>

<p>What dogged the heels of the unfortunate campaign must
be briefly told. Vigorous orders from Pope, &#8220;headquarters
in the saddle,&#8221; turned into most melancholy bombast by his
failure, occasioned either by want of brains or willful lack of
coöperation; a rebel invasion of Maryland; the battle of
South Mountain gained under McClellan; Antietam, not the
victory it might have been, for which a ream of reasons were
given; the withdrawal of the rebels; Government hard at
work urging McClellan to follow; supersedure of the latter
by the President, who survived his cabinet in clinging to
him; appointment of Burnside, much against his wishes;
another defeat at Fredericksburg; and the Army of the
Potomac in winter-quarters again.</p>

<p>Such is the summary in the East for A.&nbsp;D. 1862.</p>

<p>In the West, the year closed with the opening of the battle
of Murfreesboro and Vicksburg still held out against all our
attempts to take it.</p>

letter addressed to the President, severely criticising his
action relative to the question of slavery&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;a letter written in
ignorance of the fact that a definite policy had already been
matured, which would be announced at a suitable moment&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;Mr.
Lincoln responded as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sigright">
&#8220;<i>Executive Mansion</i>, Washington, Aug. 22, 1862.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hon. Horace Greeley</span>&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;<i>Dear Sir</i>: I have just read yours
of the 19th, addressed to myself through the <i>New York
Tribune</i>. If there be in it any statements or assumptions of
fact which I may know to be erroneous, I do not now and
here controvert them. If there be in it any inference which
I may believe to be falsely drawn, I do not now and here
argue against them. If there be perceptible in it an impatient
and dictatorial tone, I waive it in deference to an old friend,
whose heart I have always supposed to be right.</p>

<p>&#8220;As to the policy I &#8216;seem to be pursuing,&#8217; as you say, I
have not meant to leave any one in doubt.</p>

<p>&#8220;I would save the Union. I would save it the shortest
way under the Constitution. The sooner the National
authority can be restored, the nearer the Union will be &#8216;the
Union as it was.&#8217; If there be those who would not save the
Union unless they could at the same time <i>save</i> Slavery, I do
not agree with them. If there be those who would not save
the Union unless they could at the same time <i>destroy</i> Slavery,
I do not agree with them. My paramount object in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
struggle <i>is</i> to save the Union, and is <i>not</i> either to save or
destroy Slavery. If I could save the Union without freeing
<i>any</i> slave, I would do it; and if I could do it by freeing <i>all</i>
the slaves, I would do it; and if I could do it by freeing some
and leaving others alone, I would also do that. What I do
about Slavery and the colored race, I do because I believe it
helps to save this Union; and what I forbear, I forbear
because I do <i>not</i> believe it would help to save the Union. I
shall do <i>less</i> whenever I shall believe what I am doing hurts
the cause, and I shall do <i>more</i> whenever I shall believe doing
more will help the cause. I shall try to correct errors when
shown to be errors; and I shall adopt new views so fast as
they shall appear to be true views. I have here stated my
purpose according to my view of <i>official</i> duty, and I intend
no modification of my oft-expressed <i>personal</i> wish that all
men, every where, could be free.</p>

</p></blockquote>

<p>What that policy was, every manly heart learned with delight
when the following Proclamation appeared, the most
important state-paper ever penned by any American President:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;I, <span class="smcap">Abraham Lincoln</span>, President of the United States of
America, and Commander-in-chief of the Army and Navy
thereof, do hereby proclaim and declare, that hereafter, as
heretofore, the war will be prosecuted for the object of practically
restoring the constitutional relation between the United
States and the people thereof, in those States in which that
relation is, or may be, suspended or disturbed; that it is my
purpose, upon the next meeting of Congress, to again recommend
the adoption of a practical measure tendering pecuniary
aid to the free acceptance or rejection of all the Slave States,
so-called, the people whereof may not then be in rebellion
against the United States, and which States may then have
voluntarily adopted, or thereafter may voluntarily adopt, the
immediate or gradual abolishment of slavery within their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
respective limits, and that the effort to colonize persons of
African descent, with their consent, upon the continent or
elsewhere, with the previously obtained consent of the government
existing there, will be continued; that on the first
day of January, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight
hundred and sixty-three, all persons held as slaves within
any State, or any designated part of a State, the people
whereof shall then be in rebellion against the United States,
<span class="smcap">SHALL BE THEN, THENCEFORWARD AND FOREVER, FREE</span>, and the
Executive Government of the United States, including the
military and naval authority thereof, will recognize and
maintain the freedom of such persons, and will do no act or
acts to repress such persons, or any of them, in any efforts
they may make for their actual freedom; that the Executive
will, on the first day of January aforesaid, by proclamation,
designate the States, and parts of States, if any, in which the
people thereof respectively shall be in rebellion against
the United States; and the fact that any State, or the people
thereof, shall on that day be in good faith represented in the
Congress of the United States by members chosen thereto,
at elections wherein a majority of the qualified voters of such
State shall have participated, shall, in the absence of strong
countervailing testimony, be deemed conclusive evidence that
such State and the people thereof have not been in rebellion
against the United States.</p>

<p>&#8220;That attention is hereby called to an act of Congress,
entitled, &#8216;An act to make an additional article of war,&#8217; approved
March 13, 1862, and which act is in the words and
figures following:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;<i>Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives
of the United States of America, in Congress assembled</i>, That
hereafter the following shall be promulgated as an additional
Article of War for the government of the Army of the United
States, and shall be observed and obeyed as such.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;<i>Article &#8203;&mdash;&#8203;.</i> All officers or persons of the military or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
naval service of the United States, are prohibited from employing
any of the forces under their respective commands
for the purpose of returning fugitives from service or labor
who may have escaped from any persons to whom such service
or labor is claimed to be due; and any officer who shall
be found guilty by a court-martial of violating this article
shall be dismissed from the service.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;<i>Section 2</i>. And be it further enacted, That this act shall
take effect from and after its passage.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Also to the ninth and tenth sections of an act entitled,
&#8216;An act to suppress insurrection, to punish treason and rebellion,
to seize and confiscate property of rebels, and for
other purposes,&#8217; approved July 17, 1862, and which sections
are in the words and figures following:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;<i>Section 9</i>. And be it further enacted, That all slaves of
persons who shall hereafter be engaged in rebellion against
the government of the United States, or who shall in any
way give aid or comfort thereto, escaping from such persons
and taking refuge within the lines of the army; and all
slaves captured from such persons or deserted by them, and
coming under the control of the government of the United
States, and all slaves of such persons found on (or being
within) any place occupied by rebel forces and afterwards
occupied by the forces of the United States, shall be deemed
captives of war, and shall be forever free of their servitude,
and not again held as slaves.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Section 10.</i> And be it further enacted, That no slave
escaping into any State, Territory, or the District of Columbia,
from any of the States, shall be delivered up, or in
any way impeded or hindered of his liberty, except for crime,
or some offence against the laws, unless the person claiming
said fugitive shall first make oath that the person to whom
the labor or service of such fugitive is alleged to be due, is
his lawful owner, and has not been in arms against the United
States in the present rebellion, nor in any way given aid and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
comfort thereto; and no person engaged in the military or
naval service of the United States shall, under any pretence
whatever, assume to decide on the validity of the claim of
any person to the service or labor of any other person, or
surrender up any such person to the claimant, on pain of
being dismissed from the service.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I do hereby enjoin upon, and order all persons
engaged in the military and naval service of the United
States to observe, obey and enforce within their respective
spheres of service, the act and sections above recited.</p>

<p>&#8220;And the executive will in due time recommend that all
citizens of the United States who shall have remained loyal
thereto throughout the rebellion, shall (upon the restoration
of the constitutional relation between the United States and
their respective States and people, if the relation shall have
been suspended or disturbed) be compensated for all losses by
acts of the United States, including the loss of slaves.</p>

<p>&#8220;In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and
caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.</p>

<p>This herald of freedom to millions was, of course, intensely
disliked by those who omitted no opportunity to cavil at the
Administration. As efforts were making&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;not entirely without
success&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;to embarrass the Government in securing the
necessary reinforcements for the army, and certain lewd fellows
of the baser sort holding themselves in readiness to take advantage
of the bitter prejudices existing in the minds of a
portion of the people against the negroes among us,
the following proclamation was issued two days later, that no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
one might plead ignorance of results, if such treasonable
practices should be persisted in:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Whereas</span>, It has become necessary to call into service, not
only volunteers, but also portions of the militia of the States by
draft, in order to suppress the insurrection existing in the
United States, and disloyal persons are not adequately restrained
by the ordinary processes of law from hindering this
measure, and from giving aid and comfort in various ways to
the insurrection:</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, therefore, be it ordered:</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>First.</i> That during the existing insurrection, and as a
necessary measure for suppressing the same, all rebels and insurgents,
their aiders and abettors, within the United States,
and all persons discouraging volunteer enlistments, resisting
militia drafts, or guilty of any disloyal practice affording aid
and comfort to the rebels against the authority of the United
States, shall be subject to martial law, and liable to trial and
punishment by courts-martial or military commission.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Third.</i> That the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> is suspended in
respect to all persons arrested, or who are now, or hereafter
during the rebellion shall be imprisoned in any fort, camp,
arsenal, military prison, or other place of confinement, by any
military authority or by the sentence of any court-martial or
military commission.</p>

<p>&#8220;In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand, and
caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Done at the City of Washington, this twenty-fourth day of

&#8220;<span class="smcap">William H. Seward</span>, Secretary of State.&#8221;<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>It would be paying but a poor compliment to the sagacity
which prompted this proclamation, if one were not obliged to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
say that it was exceedingly distasteful to many. Truth, however,
compels us to add that the evils aimed at ceased, to
a very great extent, shortly after its appearance.</p>

<p>The following order, issued November 16th, 1862, is but
one among the many evidences of that deep and earnest reverence
for Christianity which formed a noticeable feature,
not only in most of Mr. Lincoln&#8217;s official papers, but also in
the character of the man:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;The President, Commander-in-chief of the Army and
Navy, desires and enjoins the orderly observance of the Sabbath,
by the officers and men in the military and naval service.
The importance, for man and beast, of the prescribed weekly
rest, the sacred rights of Christian soldiers and sailors, a becoming
deference to the best sentiment of a Christian people,
and a due regard for the Divine will, demand that Sunday
labor in the army and navy be reduced to the measure of strict
necessity.</p>

<p>&#8220;The discipline and character of the National forces should
not suffer, nor the cause they defend be imperiled, by the profanation
of the day or name of the Most High. &#8216;At this time
of public distress,&#8217; adopting the words of Washington in
1776, &#8216;men may find enough to do in the service of God and
their country, without abandoning themselves to vice and immorality.&#8217;
The first general order issued by the Father of
his Country, after the Declaration of Independence, indicates
the spirit in which our institutions were founded and should
ever be defended: &#8216;The General hopes and trusts that every
officer and man will endeavor to live and act as becomes a
Christian soldier defending the dearest rights and liberties of
his country.&#8217;</p>

<p>On the 1st day of January, 1863, appeared that proclamation
which was to supplement that of September 22d, 1862,
crowning with complete fullness that great work and giving
it health and being:</p>

<p>&#8220;That the Executive will, on the first day of January
aforesaid, by proclamation, designate the States and parts of
States, if any, in which the people thereof respectively shall
then be in rebellion against the United States, and the fact
that any State, or the people thereof, shall on that day be in
good faith represented in the Congress of the United States
by members chosen thereto at elections wherein a majority of
the qualified voters of such State shall have participated, shall,
in the absence of strong countervailing testimony, be deemed
conclusive evidence that such State and the people thereof
are not then in rebellion against the United States.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the
United States, by virtue of the power in me vested as Commander-in-chief
of the Army and Navy of the United States,
in time of actual armed rebellion against the authority and
Government of the United States, and as a fit and necessary
war measure for repressing said rebellion, do, on this first
day of January, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight
hundred and sixty-three, and in accordance with my purpose
so to do, publicly proclaimed for the full period of one hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
days from the day of the first above-mentioned order
designate, as the States and parts of States wherein the
people thereof respectively are this day in rebellion against
the United States, the following, to wit: Arkansas, Texas,
Louisiana, except the parishes of St. Bernard, Plaquemines,
Jefferson, St. John, St. Charles, St. James, Ascension, Assumption,
Terre Bonne, Lafourche, St. Mary, St. Martin, and
Orleans, including the city of New Orleans, Mississippi, Alabama,
Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, and
Virginia, except the forty-eight counties designated as West
Virginia, and also the counties of Berkeley, Accomac, Northampton,
Elizabeth City, York, Princess Ann, and Norfolk,
including the cities of Norfolk and Portsmouth, and which
excepted parts are, for the present, left precisely as if this
proclamation were not issued.</p>

<p>&#8220;And by virtue of the power and for the purpose aforesaid,
I do order and declare that all persons held as slaves within
said designated States and parts of States are, and henceforward
shall be free; and that the Executive Government of
the United States, including the military and naval authorities
thereof, will recognize and maintain the freedom of said
persons.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I hereby enjoin upon the people so declared to be
free, to abstain from all violence, unless in necessary self-defence,
and I recommend to them, that in all cases, when
allowed, they labor faithfully for reasonable wages.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I further declare and make known that such persons
of suitable condition will be received into the armed service
of the United States to garrison forts, positions, stations, and
other places, and to man vessels of all sorts in said service.</p>

<p>&#8220;And upon this, sincerely believed to be an act of justice,
warranted by the Constitution, upon military necessity, I
invoke the considerate judgment of mankind and the gracious
favor of Almighty God.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
&#8220;In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and
caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Done at the city of Washington, this first day of January,
in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-three,
and of the Independence of the United States the
eighty-seventh.</p>

<span class="subhead">LAST SESSION OF THE THIRTY-SEVENTH CONGRESS.</span></h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">Situation of the Country&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;Opposition to the Administration&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;President&#8217;s Message.</p></blockquote>

<p>Dark days for the friends of freedom in this country were
those at the close of 1862. Prior to the autumn of that year
the elections had shown a popular indorsement of the acts of
the Administration. Then came a change. The three leading
States&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;New York, Ohio, and Pennsylvania&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;through
manifestations and misrepresentations which it is unnecessary
here to detail, had been induced to give majorities against
the Government. Not the least singular of the many remarkable
instances of inconsistency which our political annals
afford, was furnished in the State first-named, which had
actually elected a &#8220;Peace&#8221; man as its Governor, on the platform
of &#8220;a more vigorous prosecution of the war.&#8221;</p>

<p>The failure of the Peninsular Campaign was charged upon
the President. The war, it was asserted, had been perverted
from its original purpose. It was no longer waged to preserve
the Union, but to free the slave; or, in the more
elegant phraseology of the day, it had become &#8220;a nigger
war.&#8221; With the ignorant and unthinking such statements
passed as truths.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
The number of those who, never having invested any principle
in the struggle, had become tired of the war, had largely
increased. The expectation of a draft&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;or a &#8220;conscription,&#8221;
as it better suited the objects of the disaffected to term it&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;which
was passed at the next session of Congress, made the
lukewarm love of many to wax cold.</p>

<p>Newspapers and stump-speakers had the hardihood to
demand peace upon any terms. It was even claimed that an
opposition majority had been secured in the lower House of
the next Congress. Their representatives in the Congress of
1862 began to re-assume those airs of insolence and defiance
which they had previously found it convenient to lay aside
for the time.</p>

<p>Dark days, indeed, when the Thirty-seventh Congress
assembled for its last session, on the 1st of December, 1862.</p>

<p>Yet there was one who never faltered in purpose, however
discouraging the prospect; one, who, assured that he was
right, was determined to follow the right, wherever it might
lead him. And, though his careworn expression and anxious
look told plainly how the fearful responsibilities of his office
weighed upon him, he had ever a cheerful word, a happy
illustration, a kindly smile, or a look of sympathy for those
with whom he came in contact.</p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>The essential portions of his Annual Message on this occasion
are given below:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Fellow-citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives</span>:&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;Since
your last annual assembling, another
year of health and bountiful harvests has passed. And,
while it has not pleased the Almighty to bless us with a
return of peace, we can but press on, guided by the best light
He gives us, trusting that, in His own good time and wise
way, all will yet be well....</p>

<p>&#8220;If the condition of our relations with other nations is less
gratifying than it has usually been at former periods, it is certainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
more satisfactory than a nation so unhappily distracted
as we are, might reasonably have apprehended. In the month
of June last there were some grounds to expect that the maritime
powers which, at the beginning of our domestic difficulties,
so unwisely and unnecessarily, as we think, recognized
the insurgents as a belligerent, would soon recede from that
position, which has proved only less injurious to themselves
than to our own country. But the temporary reverses which
afterward befell the National arms, and which were exaggerated
by our own disloyal citizens abroad, have hitherto
delayed that act of simple justice.</p>

<p>&#8220;The civil war, which has so radically changed, for the
moment, the occupations and habits of the American people,
has necessarily disturbed the social condition, and affected
very deeply the prosperity of the nations with which we have
carried on a commerce that has been steadily increasing
throughout a period of half a century. It has, at the same
time, excited political ambitions and apprehensions which
have produced a profound agitation throughout the civilized
world. In this unusual agitation we have forborne from
taking part in any controversy between foreign States, and
between parties or factions in such States. We have attempted
no propagandism, and acknowledged no revolution.
But we have left to every nation the exclusive conduct and
management of its own affairs. Our struggle has been, of
course, contemplated by foreign nations with reference less
to its own merits, than to its supposed, and often exaggerated,
effects and consequences resulting to those nations themselves.
Nevertheless, complaint on the part of this Government, even
if it were just, would certainly be unwise.</p>

<p>&#8220;The treaty with Great Britain for the suppression of the
slave-trade, has been put into operation, with a good prospect
of complete success. It is an occasion of special pleasure to
acknowledge that the execution of it, on the part of Her
Majesty&#8217;s Government, has been marked with a jealous respect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
for the authority of the United States, and the rights of their
moral and loyal citizens....</p>

<p>&#8220;Applications have been made to me by many free Americans
of African descent to favor their emigration, with a view
to such colonization, as was contemplated in recent acts of
Congress. Other parties, at home and abroad&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;some from
interested motives, others upon patriotic considerations, and
still others influenced by philanthropic sentiments&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;have suggested
similar measures; while, on the other hand, several
of the Spanish-American republics have protested against
the sending of such colonies to their respective territories.
Under these circumstances I have declined to move any such
colony to any State, without first obtaining the consent of its
Government, with an agreement on its part to receive and
protect such emigrants in all the rights of freemen; and I
have, at the same time, offered to the several States situated
within the tropics, or having colonies there, to negotiate with
them, subject to the advice and consent of the Senate, to favor
the voluntary emigration of persons of that class to their
respective territories, upon conditions which shall be equal,
just, and humane. Liberia and Hayti are, as yet, the only
countries to which colonists of African descent from here,
could go with certainty of being received and adopted as
citizens; and I regret to say such persons, contemplating
colonization, do not seem so willing to migrate to those
countries, as to some others, nor so willing as I think their
interest demands. I believe, however, opinion among them
in this respect is improving; and that, ere long, there will
be an augmented and considerable migration to both these
countries, from the United States....</p>

<p>&#8220;I have favored the project for connecting the United
States with Europe by an Atlantic telegraph, and a similar
project to extend the telegraph from San Francisco, to connect
by a Pacific telegraph with the line which is being
extended across the Russian Empire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
&#8220;The Territories of the United States, with unimportant
exceptions, have remained undisturbed by the civil war;
and they are exhibiting such evidence of prosperity as justifies
an expectation that some of them will soon be in a
condition to be organized as States, and be constitutionally
admitted into the Federal Union.</p>

<p>&#8220;The immense mineral resources of some of those territories
ought to be developed as rapidly as possible. Every step
in that direction would have a tendency to improve the
revenues of the Government, and diminish the burdens of the
people. It is worthy of your serious consideration whether
some extraordinary measures to promote that end can not be
adopted. The means which suggests itself as most likely to
be effective, is a scientific exploration of the mineral regions
in those Territories, with a view to the publication of its
results at home and in foreign countries&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;results which can
not fail to be auspicious.</p>

<p>&#8220;The condition of the finances will claim your most
diligent consideration. The vast expenditures incident to
the military and naval operations required for the suppression
of the rebellion, have hitherto been met with a promptitude
and certainty unusual in similar circumstances; and the public
credit has been fully maintained. The continuance of the
war, however, and the increased disbursements made necessary
by the augmented forces now in the field, demand your
best reflections as to the best modes of providing the necessary
revenue, without injury to business, and with the least
possible burdens upon labor.</p>

<p>&#8220;The suspension of specie payments by the banks, soon
after the commencement of your last session, made large
issues of United States notes unavoidable. In no other way
could the payment of the troops, and the satisfaction of other
just demands, be so economically or so well provided for.
The judicious legislation of Congress, securing the receivability
of these notes for loans and internal duties, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
making them a legal tender for other debts, has made them
a universal currency; and has satisfied, partially at least,
and for the time, the long felt want of an uniform circulating
medium, saving thereby to the people immense sums in discounts
and exchanges.</p>

<p>&#8220;A return to specie payments, however, at the earliest
period compatible with due regard to all interests concerned,
should ever be kept in view. Fluctuations in the value of
currency are always injurious, and to reduce these fluctuations
to the lowest possible point, will always be a leading purpose
in wise legislation. Convertibility, prompt and certain convertibility
into coin, is generally acknowledged to be the best
and the surest safeguard against them; and it is extremely
doubtful whether a circulation of United States notes, payable
in coin, and sufficiently large for the wants of the people,
can be permanently, usefully and safely maintained.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is there, then, any other mode in which the necessary
provision for the public wants can be made, and the great
advantages of a safe and uniform currency secured?</p>

<p>&#8220;I know of none which promises so certain results, and is,
at the same time, so unobjectionable, as the organization of
banking associations, under a general Act of Congress, well
guarded in its provisions. To such associations the Government
might furnish circulating notes, on the security of the
United States bonds deposited in the treasury. These notes,
prepared under the supervision of proper officers, being
uniform in appearance and security, and convertible always
into coin, would at once protect labor against the evils of a
vicious currency, and facilitate commerce by cheap and safe
exchanges.</p>

<p>&#8220;A moderate reservation from the interest on the bonds
would compensate the United States for the preparation and
distribution of the notes, and a general supervision of the
system, and would lighten the burden of that part of the
public debt employed as securities. The public credit, moreover,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
would be greatly improved, and the negotiation of new
loans greatly facilitated by the steady market demand for
Government bonds which the adoption of the proposed system
would create.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is an additional recommendation of the measure of
considerable weight, in my judgment, that it would reconcile
as far as possible, all existing interests, by the opportunity
offered to existing institutions to reörganize under the act,
substituting only the secured uniform national circulation for
the local and various circulation, secured and unsecured, now
issued by them.</p>

<p>&#8220;The receipts into the treasury, from all sources, including
loans, and balance from the preceding year, for the fiscal year
ending on the 30th June, 1862, were $583,885,247 06, of
which sum $49,056,397 62 were derived from customs
$1,795,331 73 from the direct tax; from public lands,
$152,203 77; from miscellaneous sources, $931,787 64
from loans in all forms, $529,692,460 50. The remainder
$2,257,065 80, was the balance from last year.</p>

<p>&#8220;The disbursements during the same period were for Congressional,
Executive, and Judicial purposes, $5,939,009 29;
for foreign intercourse, $1,339,710 35; for miscellaneous
expenses, including the mints, loans, post office deficiencies,
collection of revenue, and other like charges, $14,129,771 50;
for expenses under the Interior Department, $3,102,985 52;
under the War Department, $394,368,407 36; under the
Navy Department, $42,674,569 69; for interest on public
debt, $13,190,324 45; and for payment of public debt, including
reimbursement of temporary loan, and redemptions
$96,096,922 09; making an aggregate of $570,841,700 25,
and leaving a balance in the treasury on the first day of July,
1862, of $13,043,546 81.</p>

<p>&#8220;It should be observed that the sum of $96,096,922 09,
expended for reimbursements and redemption of public debt,
being included also in the loans made, may be properly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
deducted, both from receipts and expenditures, leaving the
actual receipts for the year, $487,788,324 97; and the expenditures,
$474,744,778 16....</p>

<p>&#8220;On the 22d day of September last a proclamation was
issued by the Executive, a copy of which is herewith submitted.</p>

<p>&#8220;In accordance with the purpose expressed in the second
paragraph of that paper, I now respectfully call your attention
to what may be called &#8216;compensated emancipation.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;A nation may be said to consist of its territory, its people
and its laws. The territory is the only part which is of
certain durability. &#8216;One generation passeth away and another
generation cometh, but the earth abideth forever.&#8217; It is of
the first importance to duly consider, and estimate, this ever-enduring
part. That portion of the earth&#8217;s surface which is
owned and inhabited by the people of the United States, is
well adapted to be the home of one national family; and it is
not well adapted for two or more. Its vast extent, and its
variety of climate and productions, are of advantage, in this
age, for one people, whatever they might have been in former
ages. Steam, telegraphs and intelligence have brought these
to be an advantageous combination for one united people.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the inaugural address I briefly pointed out the total
inadequacy of disunion, as a remedy for the differences between
the people of the two sections. I did so in language
which I can not improve, and which, therefore, I beg to
repeat:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;One section of our country believes Slavery is <i>right</i>, and
ought to be extended, while the other believes it is <i>wrong</i>
and ought not to be extended. This is the only substantial
dispute. The fugitive slave clause of the Constitution, and
the law for the suppression of the foreign slave-trade, are each
as well enforced, perhaps, as any law can ever be in a community
where the moral sense of the people imperfectly
supports the law itself. The great body of the people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
abide by the dry legal obligation in both cases, and a
few break over in each. This, I think, can not be
perfectly cured; and it would be worse in both cases <i>after</i>
the separation of the sections, than before. The foreign
slave-trade, now imperfectly suppressed, would be ultimately
revived without restriction in one section; while fugitive
slaves, now only partially surrendered, would not be surrendered
at all by the other.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Physically speaking, we can not separate. We can not
remove our respective sections from each other, nor build an
impassable wall between them. A husband and wife may be
divorced, and go out of the presence, and beyond the reach
of each other; but the different parts of our country can not
do this. They cannot but remain face to face; and intercourse,
either amicable or hostile, must continue between
them. Is it possible, then, to make that intercourse more
advantageous, or more satisfactory, <i>after</i> separation than
<i>before</i>? Can aliens make treaties easier than friends can
make laws? Can treaties be more faithfully enforced between
aliens, than laws can among friends? Suppose you go to
war, you can not fight always; and when, after much loss on
both sides, and no gain on either, you cease fighting, the
identical old questions, as to terms of intercourse, are again
upon you.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;There is no line, straight or crooked, suitable for a
National boundary, upon which to divide. Trace through,
from east to west, upon the line between the free and slave
country, and we shall find a little more than one-third of its
length are rivers, easy to be crossed, and populated, or soon
to be populated, thickly, upon both sides; while nearly all its
remaining length are merely surveyors&#8217; lines, over which
people may walk back and forth without any consciousness
of their presence. No part of this line can be made any more
difficult to pass, by writing it down on paper, or parchment,
as a national boundary. The fact of separation, if it comes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
gives up, on the part of the seceding, the fugitive slave clause,
along with all other constitutional obligations upon the section
seceded from, while I should expect no treaty stipulation
would ever be made to take its place.</p>

<p>&#8220;But there is another difficulty. The great interior region,
bounded east by the Alleghanies, north by the British Dominions,
west by the Rocky Mountains, and south by the
line along which the culture of corn and cotton meets, and
which includes part of Virginia, part of Tennessee, all of
Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, Wisconsin, Illinois,
Missouri, Kansas, Iowa, Minnesota, and The territories of
Dakota, Nebraska, and part of Colorado, already has above
ten millions of people, and will have fifty million within fifty
years, if not prevented by any political folly or mistake. It
contains more than one-third of the country owned by the
United States&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;certainly more than one million of square
miles. Once half as populous as Massachusetts already is, it
would have more than seventy-five millions of people. A
glance at the map shows that, territorially speaking, it is the
great body of the Republic. The other parts are but marginal
borders to it; the magnificent region sloping west from
the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific, being the deepest, and
also the richest, in undeveloped resources. In the production
of provisions, grains, grasses, and all which proceed from
them, this great interior region is naturally one of the most
important in the world. Ascertain from the statistics the
small proportion of the region which has, as yet, been brought
into cultivation, and also the large and rapidly increasing
amount of its products, and we shall be overwhelmed with
the magnitude of the prospect presented. And yet this
region has no sea-coast, touches no ocean any where. As
part of one nation, its people now find, and may forever find,
their way to Europe by New York, to South America and
Africa by New Orleans, and to Asia by San Francisco. But
separate our common country into two nations, as designed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
by the present rebellion, and every man of this great interior
region is thereby cut off from some one or more of these
outlets, not, perhaps, by a physical barrier, but by embarrassing
and onerous trade regulations.</p>

<p>&#8220;And this is true, <i>wherever</i> a dividing or boundary line
may be fixed. Place it between the now free and slave
country, or place it south of Kentucky, or north of Ohio, and
still the truth remains, that none south of it can trade to any
port or place north of it, and none north of it can trade to any
port or place south of it, except upon terms dictated by a
government foreign to them. These outlets, east, west, and
south, are indispensable to the well-being of the people inhabiting,
and to inhabit, this vast interior region. <i>Which</i> of
the three may be the best, is no proper question. All are
better than either; and all, of right, belong to that people, and
to their successors forever. True to themselves, they will not
ask <i>where</i> a line of separation shall be, but will vow, rather,
that there shall be no such line. Nor are the marginal regions
less interested in these communications to, and through
them, to the great outside world. They, too, and each of
them, must have access to this Egypt of the West, without
paying toll at the crossing of any National boundary.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our National strife springs not from our permanent part;
not from the land we inhabit; not from our National homestead.
There is no possible severing of this, but would multiply,
and not mitigate, evils among us. In all its adaptations
and aptitudes, it demands union, and abhors separation. In
fact it would, ere long, force reunion, however much of blood
and treasure the separation might have cost.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our strife pertains to ourselves&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;to the passing generations
of men; and it can, without convulsion, be hushed forever
with the passing of one generation.</p>

<p>&#8220;In this view, I recommend the adoption of the following
resolution and articles amendatory to the Constitution of the
United States:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
&#8220;<i>Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of
the United States of America in Congress assembled</i>, (two-thirds
of both Houses concurring,) That the following articles
be proposed to the Legislatures (or conventions) of the several
States as amendments to the Constitution of the United
States, all or any of which articles, when ratified by three-fourths
of the said Legislatures (or conventions), to be valid
as part or parts of the said Constitution, viz.:</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Article &#8203;&mdash;&#8203;.</i> Every State, wherein Slavery now exists,
which shall abolish the same therein, at any time, or times,
before the first day of January, in the year of our Lord one
thousand and nine hundred, shall receive compensation from
the United States as follows, to wit:</p>

<p>&#8220;The President of the United States shall deliver, to every
such States, bonds of the United States, bearing interest at
the rate of &#8203;&mdash;&#8203;&mdash; per cent. per annum, to an amount equal to
the aggregate sum of &#8203;&mdash;&#8203;&mdash; for each slave shown to
have been therein, by the eighth census of the United States,
said bonds to be delivered to such State by installments, or in
one parcel, at the completion of the abolishment, accordingly
as the same shall have been gradual, or at one time, within
such State; and interest shall begin to run upon any such
bond, only from the proper time of its delivery as aforesaid.
Any State, having received bonds as aforesaid, and afterward
re-introducing or tolerating slavery therein, shall refund to
the United States the bonds so received, or the value thereof,
and all interest paid thereon.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Article &#8203;&mdash;&#8203;.</i> All slaves who shall have enjoyed actual
freedom by the chances of the war, at any time before the
end of the rebellion, shall be forever free; but all owners of
such, who shall not have been disloyal, shall be compensated
for them, at the same rates as is provided for States adopting
abolishment of slavery, but in such way, that no slave shall
be twice accounted for.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Article &#8203;&mdash;&#8203;.</i> Congress may appropriate money, and otherwise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
provide for colonizing free colored persons, with their
own consent, at any place or places without the United
States.</p>

<p>&#8220;I beg indulgence to discuss these proposed articles at some
length. Without slavery, the rebellion could never have existed;
without slavery, it could not continue.</p>

<p>&#8220;Among the friends of the Union, there is great diversity
of sentiment, and of policy, in regard to slavery, and the
African race among us. Some would perpetuate slavery;
some would abolish it suddenly, and without compensation;
some would abolish it gradually, and with compensation;
some would remove the freed people from us, and some
would retain them with us; and there are yet other minor diversities.
Because of these diversities, we waste much strength
in struggles among ourselves. By mutual concession we
should harmonize, and act together. This would be compromise;
but it would be compromise among the friends, and
not with the enemies of the Union. These articles are intended
to embody a plan of such mutual concessions. If the
plan shall be adopted, it is assumed that emancipation will
follow, at least in several of the States.</p>

<p>&#8220;As to the first article, the main points are: first, the
emancipation; secondly, the length of time for consummating
it&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;thirty-seven years; and thirdly, the compensation.</p>

<p>&#8220;The emancipation will be unsatisfactory to the advocates
of perpetual slavery; but the length of time should greatly
mitigate their dissatisfaction. The time spares both races
from the evils of sudden derangement&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;in fact, from the
necessity of any derangement&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;while most of those whose
habitual course of thought will be disturbed by the measure,
will have passed away before its consummation. They will
never see it. Another class will hail the prospect of emancipation,
but will deprecate the length of time. They will feel
that it gives too little to the now living slaves. But it really
gives them much. It saves them from the vagrant destitution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
which must largely attend immediate emancipation in localities
where their numbers are very great; and it gives the
inspiring assurance that their posterity shall be free forever.
The plan leaves to each State, choosing to act under it, to
abolish slavery now, or at the end of the century, or at any
intermediate time, or by degrees extending over the whole
or any part of the period; and it obliges no two States to
proceed alike. It also provides for compensation, and, generally,
the mode of making it. This, it would seem, must
further mitigate the dissatisfaction of those who favor perpetual
slavery, and especially of those who are to receive the
compensation. Doubtless, some of those who are to pay, and
not to receive, will object. Yet the measure is both just and
economical. In a certain sense, the liberation of slaves is the
destruction of property&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;property acquired by descent, or by
purchase, the same as any other property. It is no less true
for having been often said, that the people of the South are
not more responsible for the original introduction of this
property, than are the people of the North; and when it is
remembered how unhesitatingly we all use cotton and sugar
and share the profits of dealing in them, it may not be quite
safe to say, that the South has been more responsible than the
North for its continuance. If, then, for a common object, this
property is to be sacrificed, is it not just that it be done at a
common charge?</p>

<p>&#8220;And if, with less money, or money more easily paid, we
can preserve the benefits of the Union by this means, than we
can by the war alone, is it not also economical to do it? Let
us consider it then. Let us ascertain the sum we have expended
in the war since compensated emancipation was proposed
last March, and consider whether, if that measure had
been promptly accepted, by even some of the slave States, the
same sum would not have done more to close the war, than
has been otherwise done. If so, the measure would save
money, and, in that view, would be a prudent and economical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
measure. Certainly it is not so easy to pay <i>something</i> as it
is to pay <i>nothing</i>; but it is easier to pay a <i>large</i> sum, than it
is to pay a <i>larger</i> one. And it is easier to pay any sum
<i>when</i> we are able, than it is to pay it <i>before</i> we are able.
The war requires large sums, and requires them at once.
The aggregate sum necessary for compensated emancipation,
of course, would be large. But it would require no ready
cash; nor the bonds even, any faster than the emancipation
progresses. This might not, and probably would not, close
before the end of the thirty-seven years. At that time we
shall probably have a hundred millions of people to share the
burden, instead of thirty-one millions, as now. And not only
so, but the increase of our population may be expected to
continue for a long time after that period, as rapidly as before;
because our territory will not have become full. I do
not state this inconsiderately. At the same ratio of increase
which we have maintained, on an average, from our first
National census, in 1790, until that of 1860, we should, in
1900, have a population of one hundred and three million, two
hundred and eight thousand, four hundred and fifteen. And
why may we not continue that ratio far beyond that period?
Our abundant room&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;our broad National homestead&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;is our
ample resource. Were our territory as limited as are the
British Isles, very certainly our population could not expand
as stated. Instead of receiving the foreign born, as now, we
should be compelled to send part of the native born away.
But such is not our condition. We have two millions nine
hundred and sixty-three thousand square miles. Europe has
three millions and eight hundred thousand, with a population
averaging seventy-three and one-third persons to the square
mile. Why may not our country, at some time, average as
many? Is it less fertile? Has it more waste surface, by
mountains, rivers, lakes, deserts, or other causes? Is it inferior
to Europe in any natural advantage? If, then, we are,
at some time, to be as populous as Europe, how soon? As<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
to when this <i>may</i> be, we can judge by the past and the present,
as to when it <i>will</i> be, if ever, depends much on whether
we maintain the Union. Several of our States are already
above the average of Europe&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;seventy-three and a third to
the square mile. Massachusetts has one hundred and fifty-seven;
Rhode Island, one hundred and thirty-three; Connecticut,
ninety-nine; New York and New Jersey, each, eighty.
Also two other great States, Pennsylvania and Ohio, are not
far below, the former having sixty-three and the latter fifty-nine.
The States already above the European average, except
New York, have increased in as rapid a ratio, since
passing that point, as ever before; while no one of them is
equal to some other parts of our country, in natural capacity
for sustaining a dense population.</p>

<p>&#8220;Taking the nation in the aggregate, and we find its population
and ratio of increase, for the several decennial periods,
to be as follows:</p>

<p>&#8220;This shows an average decennial increase of 34.60 per
cent. in population through the seventy years from our first
to our last census yet taken. It is seen that the ratio of increase,
at one of these seven periods, is either two per cent.
below, or two per cent. above, the average, thus showing how
inflexible, and, consequently, how reliable, the law of increase,
in our case is. Assuming that it will continue, gives the following
results:</p>

<table class="narrow" summary="Future population">

</table>

<p>&#8220;These figures show that our country <i>may</i> be as populous
as Europe now is, at some point between 1920 and 1930&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;say
about 1925&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;our territory, at seventy-three and a third
persons to the square mile, being the capacity to contain
217,186,000.</p>

<p>&#8220;And we <i>will</i> reach this, too, if we do not ourselves relinquish
the chance, by the folly and evil of disunion, or by long
and exhausting war, springing from the only great element
of National discord among us. While it can not be foreseen
exactly how much one huge example of secession, breeding
lesser ones indefinitely, would retard population, civilization,
and prosperity, no one can doubt that the extent of it would
be very great and injurious.</p>

<p>&#8220;The proposed emancipation would shorten the war, perpetuate
peace, insure this increase of population, and proportionately
the wealth of the country. With these, we should
pay all the emancipation would cost, together with our other
debt, easier than we should pay our other debt, without it.
If we had allowed our old National debt to run at six per
cent. per annum, simple interest, from the end of our Revolutionary
struggle until to-day, without paying any thing on
either principal or interest, each man of us would owe less
upon that debt now, than each man owed upon it then; and
this because our increase of men, through the whole period,
has been greater than six per cent.; has run faster than the
interest upon the debt. Thus, time alone relieves a debtor
nation, so long as its population increases faster than unpaid
interest accumulates on its debt.</p>

<p>&#8220;This fact would be no excuse for delaying payment of
what is justly due; but it shows the great importance of time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
in this connection&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;the great advantage of a policy by which
we shall not have to pay until we number a hundred millions,
what, by a different policy, we would have to pay now, when
we number but thirty-one millions. In a word, it shows that
a dollar will be much harder to pay for the war, than will be
a dollar for emancipation on the proposed plan. And then the
latter will cost no blood, no precious life. It will be a saving
of both.</p>

<p>&#8220;As to the second article, I think it would be impracticable
to return to bondage the class of persons therein contemplated.
Some of them, doubtless, in the property sense, belong
to loyal owners; and hence, provision is made in this
article for compensating such.</p>

<p>&#8220;The third article relates to the future of the freed people.
It does not oblige, but merely authorizes, Congress to aid in
colonizing such as may consent. This ought not to be regarded
as objectionable, on the one hand, or on the other, in
so much as it comes to nothing, unless by the mutual consent
of the people to be deported, and the American voters,
through their representatives in Congress.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can not make it better known than it already is, that I
strongly favor colonization. And yet I wish to say there is
an objection urged against free colored persons remaining in
the country, which is largely imaginary, if not sometimes
malicious.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is insisted that their presence would injure, and displace
white labor and white laborers. If there ever could be
a proper time for mere catch arguments, that time surely is
not now. In times like the present, men should utter nothing
for which they would not willingly be responsible through
time and in eternity. Is it true, then, that colored people can
displace any more white labor by being free, than by remaining
slaves? If they stay in their old places, they jostle no
white laborers; if they leave their old places, they leave them
open to white laborers. Logically, there is neither more nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
less of it. Emancipation, even without deportation, would,
probably enhance the wages of white labor, and, very surely,
would not reduce them. Thus, the customary amount of
labor would still have to be performed; the freed people
would surely not do more than their old proportion of it, and
very probably, for a time, would do less, leaving an increased
part to white laborers, bringing their labor into greater demand,
and, consequently, enhancing the wages of it. With deportation,
even to a limited extent, enhanced wages to white
labor is mathematically certain. Labor is like any other
commodity in the market&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;increase the demand for it, and
you increase the price of it. Reduce the supply of black
labor, by colonizing the black laborer out of the country, and,
by precisely so much you increase the demand for, and wages
of, white labor.</p>

<p>&#8220;But it is dreaded that the freed people will swarm forth,
and cover the whole land. Are they not already in the land?
Will liberation make them any more numerous? Equally
distributed among the whites of the whole country, and there
would be but one colored to seven whites. Could the one, in
any way, greatly disturb the seven? There are many communities
now, having more than one free colored person to
seven whites; and this without any apparent consciousness
of evil from it. The District of Columbia, and the States of
Maryland and Delaware, are all in this condition. The District
has more than one free colored to six whites; and yet,
in its frequent petitions to Congress, I believe it has never
presented the presence of free colored persons as one of its
grievances. But why should emancipation South send the
freed people North? People, of any color, seldom run, unless
there be something to run from. <i>Heretofore</i>, colored people,
to some extent, have fled North from bondage; and <i>now</i>,
perhaps, from both bondage and destitution. But if gradual
emancipation and deportation be adopted, they will have
neither to flee from. Their old masters will give them wages,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
at least until new laborers can be procured; and the freed
men, in turn, will gladly give their labor for the wages, till
new homes can be found for them, in congenial climes, and
with people of their own blood and race. This proposition
can be trusted on the mutual interests involved. And, in any
event, can not the North decide for itself, whether to receive
them?</p>

<p>&#8220;Again, as practice proves more than theory, in any case
has there been any irruption of colored people northward,
because of the abolishment of slavery in this District last
spring?</p>

<p>&#8220;What I have said of the proportion of free colored persons
to the whites, in the District, is from the census of
1860, having no reference to persons called contrabands, nor
to those made free by the Act of Congress abolishing slavery
here.</p>

<p>&#8220;The plan consisting of these articles is recommended, not
but that a restoration of the National authority would be
accepted without its adoption.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor will the war, nor proceedings under the proclamation
of September 22d, 1862, be stayed because of the <i>recommendation</i>
of this plan. Its timely <i>adoption</i>, I doubt not,
would bring restoration, and thereby stay both.</p>

<p>&#8220;And, notwithstanding this plan, the recommendation that
Congress provide by law for compensating any State which
may adopt emancipation, before this plan shall have been
acted upon, is hereby earnestly renewed. Such would be
only an advance part of the plan, and the same arguments
apply to both.</p>

<p>&#8220;This plan is recommended as a means, not in exclusion
of, but in addition to, all others for restoring and preserving
the National authority throughout the Union. The subject
is presented exclusively in its economical aspect. The plan
would, I am confident, secure peace more speedily, and maintain
it more permanently, than can be done by force alone;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
while all it would cost, considering amounts, and manner of
payment, and times of payment, would be easier paid than
will be the additional cost of the war, if we rely solely upon
force. It is much&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;very much&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;that it would cost no blood
at all.</p>

<p>&#8220;The plan is proposed as permanent constitutional law.
It cannot become such without the concurrence of, first, two-thirds
of Congress, and, afterward, three-fourths of the States.
The requisite three-fourths of the States, will necessarily include
seven of the slave States. Their concurrence, if
obtained, will give assurance of their severally adopting emancipation,
at no very distant day, upon the new constitutional
terms. This assurance would end the struggle now, and save
the Union forever.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not forget the gravity which should characterize a
paper addressed to the Congress of the nation, by the Chief
Magistrate of the nation. Nor do I forget that some of you
are my seniors; nor that many of you have more experience
than I, in the conduct of public affairs. Yet I trust that, in
view of the great responsibility resting upon me, you will
perceive no want of respect to yourselves, in any undue
earnestness I may seem to display.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it doubted, then, that the plan I propose, if adopted,
would shorten the war, and thus lessen its expenditure
of money and of blood? Is it doubted that it would restore
the national authority and national prosperity, and perpetuate
both indefinitely? Is it doubted that we here&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;Congress and
Executive&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;can secure its adoption? Will not the good
people respond to a united and earnest appeal from us? Can
we, can they, by any other means, so certainly or so speedily,
assure these vital objects? We can succeed only by concert.
It is not, &#8216;Can <i>any</i> of us <i>imagine</i> better?&#8217; but, &#8216;Can we <i>all</i>
do better?&#8217; Object whatsoever is possible, still the question
recurs, &#8216;Can we do better?&#8217; The dogmas of the quiet past
are inadequate to the stormy present. The occasion is piled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
high with difficulty, and we must rise with the occasion. As
our case is new, so we must think anew, and act anew. We
must disinthrall ourselves, and then we shall save our
country.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fellow-citizens, <i>we</i> can not escape history. We of this
Congress and this Administration, will be remembered in
spite of ourselves. No personal significance, or insignificance,
can spare one or another of us. The fiery trial
through which we pass, will light us down, in honor or
dishonor, to the latest generation. We <i>say</i> we are for the
Union. The world will not forget that we say this. We
know how to save the Union. The world knows we do
know how to save it. We&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;even <i>we here</i>&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;hold the power,
and bear the responsibility. In <i>giving</i> freedom to the <i>slave</i>,
we <i>assure</i> freedom to the <i>free</i>&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;honorable alike in what we
give and what we preserve. We shall nobly save, or meanly
lose, the last best hope of earth. Other means may succeed;
this could not fail. The way is plain, peaceful, generous,
just&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;a way which, if followed, the world will forever
applaud, and God must forever bless.</p>

<p>It had been decreed by a kind Providence that the year
1863 was to mark a turn in the almost unbroken line of
reverses which the Union army had experienced for some
time previous.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
True, Hooker, who had superseded Burnside in command
of the Army of the Potomac, had been signally repulsed at
Chancellorsville; but this was more than compensated by the
decided victory achieved by the same troops, under Meade,
over the rebels at Gettysburg. Grant, by the capture of
Vicksburg, and the surrender of Port Hudson, which was the
inevitable result, had opened the Mississippi to the Gulf, and
completely severed the bastard confederacy. We moreover
secured East Tennessee, and by the victories of Lookout
Mountain and Missionary Ridge, and the repulse of a rebel
attempt to retake Knoxville, paved the way for an offensive
movement into the vitals of Georgia.</p>

<p>The sober, second thought of the people was manifest.
Vallandigham in Ohio, who for his treasonable practices had
been tried by Burnside&#8217;s order, convicted, and ordered South
to his friends, but who had been suffered to return <i>via</i> Canada,
and was put forward as the exponent of &#8220;Democracy&#8221; in
Ohio, was shelved by some one hundred thousand majority.
Pennsylvania, likewise, more than redeemed herself. In fact
every loyal State&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;except New Jersey&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;showed decided
majorities for the Administration.</p>

<p>In this election, be it remembered, the emancipation policy
of the President had entered largely as an element of discussion;
and the results were the more gratifying as it established
conclusively, that however unfavorable early indications
might have been, the great pulse of the people beat in
unison with freedom for man as man. If in a contest like
that in which the nation was then engaged, all merely mercenary
considerations could be overlooked, deep-rooted prejudices
mastered, and long withheld rights cheerfully granted,
there would be, indeed, strong grounds to hope for the
progress of our race.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the year, the President received a
gratifying evidence of the appreciation in which his efforts for
freedom were held, in a testimonial of sympathy and confidence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
from the workingmen of Manchester, England; to
which address he made the following reply:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sigright">

&#8220;<i>Executive Mansion</i>, Washington, January 19, 1863.<br />
</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">To the Workingmen of Manchester</span>:&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;I have the
honor to acknowledge the receipt of the address and resolutions
which you sent me on the eve of the new year.</p>

<p>&#8220;When I came, on the 4th of March, 1861, through a free
and constitutional election, to preside in the Government of
the United States, the country was found at the verge of
civil war. Whatever might have been the cause, or whosesoever
the fault, one duty, paramount to all others, was
before me, namely, to maintain and preserve at once the Constitution
and the integrity of the Federal Republic. A conscientious
purpose to perform this duty is the key to all the
measures of administration which have been, and to all
which will hereafter be pursued. Under our frame of government
and my official oath, I could not depart from this
purpose if I would. It is not always in the power of
governments to enlarge or restrict the scope of moral results
which follow the policies that they may deem it necessary,
for the public safety, from time to time to adopt.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have understood well that the duty of self-preservation
rests solely with the American people. But I have, at the
same time, been aware that the favor or disfavor of foreign
nations might have a material influence in enlarging and prolonging
the struggle with disloyal men in which the country
is engaged. A fair examination of history has seemed to
authorize a belief that the past action and influences of the
United States were generally regarded as having been beneficial
toward mankind. I have, therefore, reckoned upon the
forbearance of nations. Circumstances&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;to some of which
you kindly allude&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;induced me especially to expect that, if
justice and good faith should be practised by the United
States, they would encounter no hostile influence on the part
of Great Britain. It is now a pleasant duty to acknowledge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
the demonstration you have given of your desire that a spirit
of peace and amity toward this country may prevail in the
councils of your Queen, who is respected and esteemed in
your own country only more than she is by the kindred nation
which has its home on this side of the Atlantic.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know, and deeply deplore, the sufferings which the
workingmen at Manchester, and in all Europe, are called to
endure in this crisis. It has been often and studiously
represented that the attempt to overthrow this Government,
which was built upon the foundation of human rights, and to
substitute for it one which should rest exclusively on the
basis of human slavery, was likely to obtain the favor of
Europe. Through the action of our disloyal citizens, the
workingmen of Europe have been subjected to severe trial,
for the purpose of forcing their sanction to that attempt.
Under these circumstances, I can not but regard your decisive
utterances upon the question as an instance of sublime Christian
heroism, which has not been surpassed in any age or in
any country. It is indeed an energetic and reinspiring assurance
of the inherent power of truth, and of the ultimate
and universal triumph of justice, humanity and freedom. I
do not doubt that the sentiments you have expressed will be
sustained by your great nation; and, on the other hand, I
have no hesitation in assuring you that they will excite admiration,
esteem, and the most reciprocal feelings of friendship
among the American people. I hail this interchange of
sentiment, therefore, as an augury that, whatever else may
happen, whatever misfortune may befall your country or my
own, the peace and friendship which now exist between the
two nations will be, as it shall be my desire to make them,
perpetual.</p>

<p>On the 30th of March the following proclamation was
issued in pursuance of a request to that effect from the
Senate:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span></p><blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Whereas</span>, The Senate of the United States, devoutly
recognizing the supreme authority and just government of
Almighty God in all the affairs of men and of nations, has by
a resolution requested the President to designate and set
apart a day for National prayer and humiliation;</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">And whereas</span>, It is the duty of nations, as well as of
men, to own their dependence upon the overruling power of
God, to confess their sins and transgressions in humble sorrow
yet with assured hope that genuine repentance will lead to
mercy and pardon, and to recognize the sublime truth announced
in the Holy Scriptures, and proven by all history,
that those nations only are blessed whose God is the Lord;</p>

<p>&#8220;And, insomuch as we know that, by His Divine law,
nations, like individuals, are subjected to punishments and
chastisements in this world, may we not justly fear that the
awful calamity of civil war, which now desolates the land,
may be but a punishment inflicted upon us for our presumptuous
sins, to the needful end of our National reformation as a
whole people? We have been the recipients of the choicest
bounties of Heaven. We have been preserved, these many
years, in peace and prosperity. We have grown in numbers,
wealth and power, as no other nation has ever grown. But
we have forgotten God. We have forgotten the gracious
hand which preserved us in peace, and multiplied and enriched
and strengthened us; and we have vainly imagined, in
the deceitfulness of our hearts, that all these blessings were
produced by some superior wisdom and virtue of our own.
Intoxicated with unbroken success, we have become too self-sufficient
to feel the necessity of redeeming and preserving
grace, too proud to pray to the God that made us!</p>

<p>&#8220;It behooves us, then, to humble ourselves before the
offended Power, to confess our National sins, and to pray for
clemency and forgiveness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, therefore, in compliance with the request, and fully
concurring in the views of the Senate, I do, by this my proclamation,
designate and set apart Thursday, the thirteenth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
day of April, 1863, as a day of National humiliation, fasting
and prayer. And I do hereby request all the people to
abstain on that day from their ordinary secular pursuits, and
to unite, at their several places of public worship and their
respective homes, in keeping the day holy to the Lord, and
devoted to the humble discharge of the religious duties proper
to that solemn occasion.</p>

<p>&#8220;All this being done in sincerity and truth, let us then
rest humbly in the hope, authorized by the Divine teachings,
that the united cry of the Nation will be heard on high, and
answered with blessings, no less than the pardon of our
National sins, and restoration of our now divided and suffering
country to its former happy condition of unity and peace.</p>

<p>&#8220;In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand, and
caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Done at the City of Washington, on this thirtieth day of
March, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred
and sixty-three, and of the Independence of the United States
the eighty-seventh.</p>

<p>
&#8220;By the President:      <span class="right"><span class="smcap">Abraham Lincoln</span>.</span><br />

&#8220;<span class="smcap">William H. Seward</span>, Secretary of State.&#8221;<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>The following letter, which belongs in this place, will explain
itself:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sigright">
&#8220;<i>Executive Mansion</i>, Washington, June 13th, 1863.<br />
</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Hon. Erastus Corning</span> and others&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;<i>Gentlemen</i>:&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;Your
letter of May 19th, inclosing the resolutions of a public meeting
held at Albany, New York, on the 16th of the same
month, was received several days ago.</p>

<p>&#8220;The resolutions, as I understand them, are resolvable into
two propositions&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;first, the expression of a purpose to sustain
the cause of the Union, to secure peace through victory, and
to support the Administration in every constitutional and
lawful measure to suppress the rebellion; and, secondly, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
declaration of censure upon the Administration for supposed
unconstitutional action, such as the making of military arrests.
And from the two propositions a third is deduced, which is,
that the gentlemen composing the meeting are resolved on
doing their part to maintain our common Government and
country, despite the folly or wickedness, as they may conceive,
of any Administration. This position is eminently
patriotic, and as such I thank the meeting and congratulate
the nation for it. My own purpose is the same; so that the
meeting and myself have a common object, and can have no
difference, except in the choice of means or measures for
effecting that object.</p>

<p>&#8220;And here I ought to close this paper, and would close it, if
there were no apprehension that more injurious consequences
than any merely personal to myself might follow the censures
systematically cast upon me for doing what, in my view of
duty, I could not forbear. The resolutions promise to support
me in every constitutional and lawful measure to suppress
the rebellion, and I have not knowingly employed, nor
shall knowingly employ, any other. But the meeting, by
their resolutions, assert and argue that certain military
arrests and proceedings following them, for which I am ultimately
responsible, are unconstitutional. I think they are
not. The resolutions quote from the Constitution the definition
of treason, and also the limiting safeguards and guaranties
therein provided for the citizen on trial for treason, and
on his being held to answer for capital, or otherwise infamous
crimes; and in criminal prosecutions, his right to a speedy
and public trial by an impartial jury. They proceed to resolve,
&#8216;that these safeguards of the rights of the citizen
against the pretensions of arbitrary power were intended
more <i>especially</i> for his protection in times of civil commotion.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;And, apparently to demonstrate the proposition, the
resolutions proceed: &#8216;They were secured substantially to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
English people <i>after</i> years of protracted civil war, and were
adopted into our Constitution at the <i>close</i> of the Revolution.
Would not the demonstration have been better if it could have
been truly said that these safeguards had been adopted and
applied <i>during</i> the civil wars and <i>during</i> our Revolution, instead
of <i>after</i> the one and at the <i>close</i> of the other? I, too,
am devotedly for them <i>after</i> civil war, and <i>before</i> civil war,
and at all times, &#8216;except when, in cases of rebellion or invasion,
the public safety may require&#8217; their suspension. The
resolutions proceed to tell us that these safeguards &#8216;have
stood the test of seventy-six years of trial, under our republican
system, under circumstances which show that, while
they constitute the foundation of all free government, they
are the elements of the enduring stability of the Republic.&#8217;
No one denies that they have so stood the test up to the
beginning of the present rebellion, if we except a certain occurrence
at New Orleans; nor does any one question that
they will stand the same test much longer after the rebellion
closes. But these provisions of the Constitution have no application
to the case we have in hand, because the arrests
complained of were not made for treason&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;that is, not for <i>the</i>
treason defined in the Constitution, and upon conviction of
which the punishment is death&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;nor yet were they made to
hold persons to answer for any capital or otherwise infamous
crimes; nor were the proceedings following, in any constitutional
or legal sense, &#8216;criminal prosecutions.&#8217; The arrests
were made on totally different grounds, and the proceedings
following accorded with the grounds of the arrest. Let
us consider the real case with which we are dealing, and
apply to it the parts of the Constitution plainly made for such
cases.</p>

<p>&#8220;Prior to my installation here, it had been inculcated that
any State had a lawful right to secede from the National
Union, and that it would be expedient to exercise the right
whenever the devotees of the doctrine should fail to elect a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
President to their own liking. I was elected contrary to
their liking, and accordingly, so far as it was legally possible,
they had taken seven States out of the Union, and had seized
many of the United States forts, and had fired upon the
United States flag, all before I was inaugurated, and, of
course, before I had done any official act whatever. The rebellion
thus began soon ran into the present civil war; and,
in certain respects, it began on very unequal terms between
the parties. The insurgents had been preparing for it for
more than thirty years, while the Government had taken no
steps to resist them. The former had carefully considered all
the means which could be turned to their account. It undoubtedly
was a well-pondered reliance with them that, in
their own unrestricted efforts to destroy Union, Constitution,
and law together, the Government would, in a great degree,
be restrained by the same Constitution and law from arresting
their progress. Their sympathizers pervaded all departments
of the Government, and nearly all communities of the
people. From this material, under cover of &#8216;liberty of
speech,&#8217; &#8216;liberty of the press,&#8217; and &#8216;<i>habeas corpus</i>,&#8217; they
hoped to keep on foot among us a most efficient corps of
spies, informers, suppliers, and aiders and abettors of their
cause in a thousand ways. They knew that in times such as
they were inaugurating, by the Constitution itself, the &#8216;<i>habeas
corpus</i>&#8217; might be suspended; but they also knew they had
friends who would make a question as to <i>who</i> was to suspend
it; meanwhile, their spies and others might remain at large
to help on their cause. Or if, as has happened, the Executive
should suspend the writ, without ruinous waste of time,
instances of arresting innocent persons might occur, as are
always likely to occur in such cases, and then a clamor could
be raised in regard to this which might be, at least, of some
service to the insurgent cause. It needed no very keen perception
to discover this part of the enemy&#8217;s programme, so
soon as, by open hostilities, their machinery was put fairly in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>motion. Yet, thoroughly imbued with a reverence for the
guaranteed rights of individuals, I was slow to adopt the
strong measures which by degrees I have been forced to regard
as being within the exceptions of the Constitution, and
as indispensable to the public safety. Nothing is better
known to history than that courts of justice are utterly incompetent
to such cases. Civil courts are organized chiefly for
trials of individuals, or, at most, a few individuals acting in
concert, and this in quiet times, and on charges of crimes well
defined in the law. Even in times of peace, bands of horse-thieves
and robbers frequently grow too numerous and powerful
for the ordinary courts of justice. But what comparison,
in numbers, have such bands ever borne to the insurgent
sympathizers even in many of the loyal States? Again, a
jury too frequently has at least one member more ready
to hang the panel, than to hang the traitor. And yet, again
he who dissuades one man from volunteering, or induces one
soldier to desert, weakens the Union cause as much as he
who kills a Union soldier in battle. Yet this dissuasion
or inducement may be so conducted as to be no defined
crime of which any civil court would take cognizance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ours is a case of rebellion&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;so called by the resolution
before me&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;in fact, a clear, flagrant, and gigantic case of
rebellion; and the provision of the Constitution that &#8216;the
privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> shall not be suspended
unless when, in cases of rebellion or invasion, the public
safety may require it,&#8217; is <i>the</i> provision which specially applies
to our present case. This provision plainly attests the understanding
of those who made the Constitution, that ordinary
courts of justice are inadequate to &#8216;cases of rebellion&#8217;&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;attests
their purpose that, in such cases, men may be held in custody
whom the courts, acting on ordinary rules, would discharge.
<i>Habeas corpus</i> does not discharge men who are proved to be
guilty of defined crime; and its suspension is allowed by the
Constitution on purpose that men may be arrested and held<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
who can not be proved to be guilty of defined crime, &#8216;when,
in cases of rebellion or invasion, the public safety may require
it.&#8217; This is precisely our present case&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;a case of rebellion,
wherein the public safety <i>does</i> require the suspension. Indeed,
arrests by process of courts, and arrests in cases of
rebellion, do not proceed altogether upon the same basis.
The former is directed at the small percentage of ordinary and
continuous perpetration of crime; while the latter is directed
at sudden and extensive uprisings against the Government,
which at most will succeed or fail in no great length of time.
In the latter case arrests are made, not so much for what has
been done as for what probably would be done. The latter
is more for the preventive and less for the vindictive than the
former. In such cases the purposes of men are much more
easily understood than in cases of ordinary crime. The man
who stands by and says nothing when the peril of his Government
is discussed, can not be misunderstood. If not hindered,
he is sure to help the enemy; much more, if he talks ambiguously&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;talks
for his country with &#8216;buts,&#8217; and &#8216;ifs&#8217; and &#8216;ands.&#8217;
Of how little value the constitutional provisions I have
quoted will be rendered, if arrests shall never be made until
defined crimes shall have been committed, may be illustrated
by a few notable examples. General John C. Breckinridge,
General Robert E. Lee, General Joseph E. Johnston, General
John B. Magruder, General William B. Preston, General
Simon B. Buckner, and Commodore Franklin Buchanan, now
occupying the very highest places in the rebel war service,
were all within the power of the Government since the rebellion
began, and were nearly as well known to be traitors
then as now. Unquestionably, if we had seized and held
them, the insurgent cause would be much weaker. But no
one of them had then committed any crime defined by law.
Every one of them, if arrested, would have been discharged
on <i>habeas corpus</i>, were the writ allowed to operate. In view
of these and similar cases, I think the time not unlikely to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>come when I shall be blamed for having made too few arrests
rather than too many.</p>

<p>&#8220;By the third resolution, the meeting indicate their opinion
that military arrests may be constitutional in localities where
rebellion actually exists, but that such arrests are unconstitutional
in localities where rebellion or insurrection does <i>not</i>
actually exist. They insist that such arrests shall not be
made &#8216;outside of the lines of necessary military occupation
and the scenes of insurrection.&#8217; Inasmuch, however, as the
Constitution itself makes no such distinction, I am unable to
believe that there <i>is</i> any such constitutional distinction. I
concede that the class of arrests complained of can be constitutional
only when, in cases of rebellion or invasion, the public
safety may require them; and I insist that in such cases
they are Constitutional <i>wherever</i> the public safety does require
them; as well in places to which they may prevent the
rebellion extending, as in those where it may be already
prevailing; as well where they may restrain mischievous interference
with the raising and supplying of armies to suppress
the rebellion, as where the rebellion may actually be; as well
where they may restrain the enticing men out of the army, as
where they would prevent mutiny in the army; equally constitutional
at all places where they will conduce to the public
safety, as against the dangers of rebellion or invasion. Take
the particular case mentioned by the meeting. It is asserted,
in substance, that Mr. Vallandigham was, by a military commander,
seized and tried &#8216;for no other reason than words
addressed to a public meeting, in criticism of the course of
the Administration, and in condemnation of the military
orders of the general.&#8217; Now, if there be no mistake about
this; if this assertion is the truth and the whole truth; if
there was no other reason for the arrest, then I concede that
the arrest was wrong. But the arrest, as I understand, was
made for a very different reason. Mr. Vallandigham avows
his hostility to the war on the part of the Union; and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
arrest was made because he was laboring, with some effect,
to prevent the raising of troops; to encourage desertion from
the army, and to leave the rebellion without an adequate military
force to suppress it. He was not arrested because he
was damaging the political prospects of the Administration,
or the personal interests of the commanding general, but because
he was damaging the army, upon the existence and
vigor of which the life of the nation depends. He was warring
upon the military, and this gave the military constitutional
jurisdiction to lay hands upon him. If Mr. Vallandigham
was not damaging the military power of the country,
then this arrest was made on mistake of fact, which I would
be glad to correct on reasonably satisfactory evidence.</p>

<p>&#8220;I understand the meeting whose resolutions I am considering
to be in favor of suppressing the rebellion by military
force&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;by armies. Long experience has shown that armies
cannot be maintained unless desertions shall be punished by
the severe penalty of death. The case requires, and the law
and the Constitution sanction, this punishment. Must I
shoot a simple-minded soldier boy who deserts, while I must
not touch a hair of a wily agitator who induces him to desert?
This is none the less injurious when effected by getting a
father, or brother, or friend, into a public meeting, and there
working upon his feelings till he is persuaded to write the
soldier boy that he is fighting in a bad cause, for a wicked
Administration of a contemptible Government, too weak to
arrest and punish him if he shall desert. I think that in such
a case to silence the agitator and save the boy is not only
constitutional, but withal a great mercy.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I be wrong on this question of constitutional power,
my error lies in believing that certain proceedings are constitutional
when, in cases of rebellion or invasion, the public
safety requires them, which would not be constitutional when,
in the absence of rebellion or invasion, the public safety does
<i>not</i> require them; in other words, that the Constitution is not,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
in its application, in all respects the same&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;in cases of rebellion
or invasion involving the public safety, as it is in time of
profound peace and public security. The Constitution itself
makes the distinction; and I can no more be persuaded that
the Government can constitutionally take no strong measures
in time of rebellion, because it can be shown that the same
could not be lawfully taken in time of peace, than I can be
persuaded that a particular drug is not good medicine for a
sick man, because it can be shown not to be good food for a
well one. Nor am I able to appreciate the danger apprehended
by the meeting, that the American people will, by
means of military arrests during the rebellion, lose the right
of public discussion, the liberty of speech and the press, the
law of evidence, trial by jury, and <i>habeas corpus</i>, throughout
the indefinite peaceful future, which I trust lies before them,
any more than I am able to believe that a man could contract
so strong an appetite for emetics, during temporary illness, as
to persist in feeding upon them during the remainder of his
healthful life.</p>

<p>&#8220;In giving the resolutions that earnest consideration which
you request of me, I can not overlook the fact that the meeting
speak as &#8216;Democrats.&#8217; Nor can I, with full respect for
their known intelligence, and the fairly presumed deliberation
with which they prepared their resolutions, be permitted to
suppose that this occurred by accident, or in any way other
than that they preferred to designate themselves &#8216;Democrats&#8217;
rather than &#8216;American Citizens.&#8217; In this time of National
peril, I would have preferred to meet you on a level one step
higher than any party platform; because I am sure that, from
such more elevated position, we could do better battle for the
country we all love than we possibly can from those lower
ones where, from the force of habit, the prejudices of the past,
and selfish hopes of the future, we are sure to expend much
of our ingenuity and strength in finding fault with and aiming
blows at each other. But, since you have denied me this, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
will yet be thankful for the country&#8217;s sake, that not all Democrats
have done so. He on whose discretionary judgment
Mr. Vallandigham was arrested and tried is a Democrat,
having no old party affinity with me; and the judge who rejected
the constitutional view expressed in these resolutions,
by refusing to discharge Mr. Vallandigham on <i>habeas corpus</i>,
is a Democrat of better days than these, having received his
judicial mantle at the hands of President Jackson. And
still more, of all those Democrats who are nobly exposing
their lives and shedding their blood on the battle-field, I have
learned that many approve the course taken with Mr. Vallandigham,
while I have not heard of a single one condemning
it. I can not assert that there are none such.</p>

<p>&#8220;And the name of Jackson recalls an incident of pertinent
history: After the battle of New Orleans, and while the fact
that the treaty of peace had been concluded was well known
in the city, but before official knowledge of it had arrived,
Gen. Jackson still maintained martial or military law. Now
that it could be said the war was over, the clamor against
martial law, which had existed from the first, grew more
furious. Among other things, a Mr. Louiallier published a
denunciatory newspaper article. Gen. Jackson arrested him.
A lawyer by the name of Morrel procured the United States
Judge Hall to issue a writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> to relieve Mr.
Louiallier. Gen. Jackson arrested both the lawyer and the
judge. A Mr. Hollander ventured to say of some part of
the matter that &#8216;it was a dirty trick.&#8217; Gen. Jackson arrested
him. When the officer undertook to serve the writ of <i>habeas
corpus</i>, Gen. Jackson took it from him, and sent him away
with a copy. Holding the judge in custody a few days, the
general sent him beyond the limits of his encampment, and
set him at liberty, with an order to remain till the ratification
of peace should be regularly announced, or until the British
should have left the Southern coast. A day or two more
elapsed, the ratification of a treaty of peace was regularly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
announced, and the judge and others were fully liberated.
A few days more, and the judge called Gen. Jackson into
court and fined him $1,000 for having arrested him and the
others named. The general paid the fine, and there the
matter rested for nearly thirty years, when Congress refunded
principal and interest. The late Senator Douglas,
then in the House of Representatives, took a leading part in
the debates, in which the constitutional question was much
discussed. I am not prepared to say whom the journals
would show to have voted for the measure.</p>

<p>&#8220;It may be remarked: First, that we had the same Constitution
then as now; secondly, that we then had a case of
invasion, and now we have a case of rebellion; and, thirdly,
that the permanent right of the people to public discussion,
the liberty of speech and of the press, the trial by jury, the
law of evidence, and the <i>habeas corpus</i>, suffered no detriment
whatever by that conduct of Gen. Jackson, or its subsequent
approval by the American Congress.</p>

<p>&#8220;And yet, let me say that, in my own discretion, I do not
know whether I would have ordered the arrest of Mr. Vallandigham.
While I can not shift the responsibility from
myself, I hold that, as a general rule, the commander in the
field is the better judge of the necessity in any particular
case. Of course, I must practise a general directory and
revisory power in the matter.</p>

<p>&#8220;One of the resolutions expresses the opinion of the meeting
that arbitrary arrests will have the effect to divide and
distract those who should be united in suppressing the rebellion,
and I am specifically called on to discharge Mr. Vallandigham.
I regard this as, at least, a fair appeal to me on
the expediency of exercising a constitutional power which I
think exists. In response to such appeal, I have to say, it
gave me pain when I learned that Mr. Vallandigham had
been arrested&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;that is, I was pained that there should have
seemed to be a necessity for arresting him&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;and that it will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
afford me great pleasure to discharge him so soon as I can,
by any means, believe the public safety will not suffer by it.
I further say that, as the war progresses, it appears to me,
opinion and action which were in great confusion at first,
take shape and fall into more regular channels, so that the
necessity for strong dealing with them gradually decreases.
I have every reason to desire that it should cease altogether;
and far from the least is my regard for the opinions and
wishes of those who, like the meeting at Albany, declare their
purpose to sustain the Government in every constitutional
and lawful measure to suppress the rebellion. Still, I must
continue to do so much as may seem to be required by the
public safety.</p>

<p class="sigright">
&#8220;<span class="smcap">A. Lincoln.</span>&#8221;<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. Lincoln, having been waited upon by a Committee of
Ohio &#8220;Democrats,&#8221; who urged him to recall Vallandigham,
whom they sought to exalt as a &#8220;martyr to popular rights,&#8221;
addressed the following reply, the quiet sarcasm of which is
not the least of its many good points:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sigright">

&#8220;Washington, June 29, 1863.<br />
</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>:&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;The resolutions of the Ohio Democratic
State Convention, which you present me, together with your
introductory and closing remarks, being, in position and
argument, mainly the same as the resolutions of the Democratic
meeting at Albany, New York, I refer you to my
response to the latter as meeting most of the points in the
former.</p>

<p>&#8220;This response you evidently used in preparing your
remarks, and I desire no more than that it be used with
accuracy. In a single reading of your remarks, I only discovered
one inaccuracy in matter which I suppose you took
from that paper. It is where you say, &#8216;The undersigned are
unable to agree with you in the opinion you have expressed
that the Constitution is different in time of insurrection or
invasion from what it is in time of peace and public security.&#8217;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;A recurrence to the paper will show you that I have not
expressed the opinion you suppose. I expressed the opinion
that the Constitution is different <i>in its application</i> in cases of
rebellion or invasion involving the public safety, from what it
is in times of profound peace and public security. And this
opinion I adhere to, simply because, by the Constitution itself,
things may be done in the one case which may not be done
in the other.</p>

<p>&#8220;I dislike to waste a word on a merely personal point, but
I must respectfully assure you that you will find yourselves
at fault should you ever seek for evidence to prove your
assumption that I &#8216;opposed, in discussions before the people,
the policy of the Mexican War.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;You say: &#8216;Expunge from the Constitution this limitation
upon the power of Congress to suspend the writ of <i>habeas
corpus</i>, and yet the other guaranties of personal liberty
would remain unchanged.&#8217; Doubtless, if this clause of the
Constitution, improperly called, as I think, a limitation upon
the power of Congress, were expunged, the other guaranties
would remain the same; but the question is, not how those
guaranties would stand with that clause <i>out</i> of the Constitution,
but how they stand with that clause remaining in it, in
case of rebellion or invasion involving the public safety. If
the liberty could be indulged in expunging that clause, letter
and spirit, I really think the constitutional argument would
be with you.</p>

<p>&#8220;My general view on this question was stated in the
Albany response, and hence I do not state it now. I only
add that, as seems to me, the benefit of the writ of <i>habeas
corpus</i> is the great means through which the guaranties of
personal liberty are conserved and made available in the last
resort; and corroborative of this view is the fact that Mr.
Vallandigham, in the very case in question, under the advice
of able lawyers, saw not where else to go but to the <i>habeas
corpus</i>. But by the Constitution the benefit of the writ of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
<i>habeas corpus</i> itself may be suspended, when, in case of rebellion
or invasion, the public safety may require it.</p>

<p>&#8220;You ask, in substance, whether I really claim that I may
override all the guaranteed rights of individuals, on the plea
of conserving the public safety&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;when I may choose to say
the public safety requires it. This question, divested of the
phraseology calculated to represent me as struggling for an
arbitrary personal prerogative, is either simply a question
<i>who</i> shall decide, or an affirmation that <i>nobody</i> shall decide,
what the public safety does require in cases of rebellion or
invasion. The Constitution contemplates the question as
likely to occur for decision, but it does not expressly declare
who is to decide it. By necessary implication, when rebellion
or invasion comes, the decision is to be made from time to
time; and I think the man whom, for the time, the people
have, under the Constitution, made their Commander-in-chief
of the Army and Navy, is the man who holds the power and
bears the responsibility of making it. If he uses the power
justly, the same people will probably justify him; if he
abuses it, he is in their hands, to be dealt with by all the
modes they have reserved to themselves in the Constitution.</p>

<p>&#8220;The earnestness with which you insist that persons can
only, in times of rebellion, be lawfully dealt with in accordance
with the rules for criminal trials and punishments in times of
peace, induces me to add a word to what I said on that point
in the Albany response. You claim that men may, if they
choose, embarrass those whose duty it is to combat a giant
rebellion, and then be dealt with only in turn as if there were
no rebellion. The Constitution itself rejects this view. The
military arrests and detentions which have been made, including
those of Mr. Vallandigham, which are not different
in principle from the other, have been for <i>prevention</i>, and not
for <i>punishment</i>&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;as injunctions to stay injury, as proceedings
to keep the peace&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;and hence, like proceedings in such cases
and for like reasons, they have not been accompanied with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
indictments, or trial by juries, nor in a single case by any
punishment whatever beyond what is purely incidental to the
prevention. The original sentence of imprisonment in Mr.
Vallandigham&#8217;s case was to prevent injury to the military
service only, and the modification of it was made as a less
disagreeable mode to him of securing the same prevention.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am unable to perceive an insult to Ohio in the case of
Mr. Vallandigham. Quite surely nothing of this sort was or
is intended. I was wholly unaware that Mr. Vallandigham
was, at the time of his arrest, a candidate for the Democratic
nomination for Governor, until so informed by your reading
to me the resolutions of the convention. I am grateful to
the State of Ohio for many things, especially for the brave
soldiers and officers she has given, in the present national
trial, to the armies of the Union.</p>

<p>&#8220;You claim, as I understand, that, according to my own
position in the Albany response, Mr. Vallandigham should be
released; and this because, as you claim, he has not damaged
the military service by discouraging enlistments, encouraging
desertions, or otherwise; and that if he had, he should have
been turned over to the civil authorities under the recent Act
of Congress. I certainly do not <i>know</i> that Mr. Vallandigham
has specifically and by direct language advised against enlistments
and in favor of desertions and resistance to drafting.
We all know that combinations, armed, in some instances,
to resist the arrest of deserters, began several months ago;
that more recently the like has appeared in resistance to the
enrollment preparatory to a draft; and that quite a number
of assassinations have occurred from the same <i>animus</i>.
These had to be met by military force, and this again has led
to bloodshed and death. And now, under a sense of responsibility
more weighty and enduring than any which is merely
official, I solemnly declare my belief that this hindrance
of the military, including maiming and murder, is due to the
cause in which Mr. Vallandigham has been engaged, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
a greater degree than to any other cause; and it is due to
him personally in a greater degree than to any other one
man.</p>

<p>&#8220;These things have been notorious, known to all, and of
course known to Mr. Vallandigham. Perhaps I would not
be wrong to say they originated with his especial friends and
adherents. With perfect knowledge of them he has frequently,
if not constantly, made speeches in Congress and
before popular assemblies; and if it can be shown that, with
these things staring him in the face, he has ever uttered
a word of rebuke or counsel against them, it will be a
fact greatly in his favor with me, and one of which, as
yet, I am totally ignorant. When it is known that the
whole burden of his speeches has been to stir up men against
the prosecution of the war, and that in the midst of resistance
to it he has not been known in any instance to
counsel against such resistance, it is next to impossible
to repel the inference that he has counselled directly in favor
of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;With all this before their eyes, the convention you represent
have nominated Mr. Vallandigham for Governor of
Ohio, and both they and you have declared the purpose to
sustain the National Union by all constitutional means; but,
of course, they and you, in common, reserve to yourselves to
decide what are constitutional means, and, unlike the Albany
meeting, you omit to state or intimate that, in your opinion,
an army is a constitutional means of saving the Union against
a rebellion, or even to intimate that you are conscious of an
existing rebellion being in progress with the avowed object
of destroying that very Union. At the same time, your
nominee for Governor, in whose behalf you appeal, is known
to you, and to the world, to declare against the use of an
army to suppress the rebellion. Your own attitude, therefore,
encourages desertion, resistance to the draft, and the
like, because it teaches those who incline to desert and to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
escape the draft, to believe it is your purpose to protect
them, and to hope that you will become strong enough to
do so.</p>

<p>&#8220;After a personal intercourse with you, gentlemen of
the Committee, I can not say I think you desire this effect to
follow your attitude; but I assure you that both friends and
enemies of the Union look upon it in this light. It is a substantial
hope, and by consequence, a real strength to the
enemy. If it is a false hope, and one which you would
willingly dispel, I will make the way exceedingly easy.
I send you duplicates of this letter, in order that you, or
a majority of you, may, if you choose, indorse your names
upon one of them, and return it thus indorsed to me, with
the understanding that those signing are thereby committed
to the following propositions, and to nothing else:</p>

<p>&#8220;1. That there is now a rebellion in the United States, the
object and tendency of which is to destroy the National
Union; and that, in your opinion, an army and navy are
constitutional means for suppressing that rebellion.</p>

<p>&#8220;2. That no one of you will do any thing which, in his own
judgment, will tend to hinder the increase, or favor the
decrease, or lessen the efficiency of the Army and Navy,
while engaged in the effort to suppress that rebellion; <span class="locked">and&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;3. That each of you will, in his sphere, do all he can to
have the officers, soldiers, and seamen of the Army and
Navy, while engaged in the effort to suppress the rebellion,
paid, fed, clad, and otherwise well provided and supported.</p>

<p>&#8220;And with the further understanding that upon receiving
the letter and names thus indorsed, I will cause them to be
published, which publication shall be, within itself, a revocation
of the order in relation to Mr. Vallandigham.</p>

<p>&#8220;It will not escape observation that I consent to the
release of Mr. Vallandigham upon terms not embracing any
pledge from him or from others as to what he will or will not
do. I do this because he is not present to speak for himself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
or to authorize others to speak for him; and hence I shall
expect that on returning he would not put himself practically
in antagonism with the position of his friends. But I do it
chiefly because I thereby prevail on other influential gentlemen
of Ohio to so define their position as to be of immense
value to the army&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;thus more than compensating for the consequences
of any mistake in allowing Mr. Vallandigham to
return, so that, on the whole, the public safety will not have
suffered by it. Still, in regard to Mr. Vallandigham and all
others, I must hereafter, as heretofore, do so much as the
public service may seem to require.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have the honor to be respectfully, yours, etc.,</p>

<p class="hang">Speech at Washington&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;Letter to General Grant&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;Thanksgiving Proclamation&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;Letter
concerning the Emancipation Proclamation&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;Proclamation for Annual Thanksgiving&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;Dedicatory
Speech at Gettysburg.</p></blockquote>

<p>On the evening of the 4th of July, 1863, having been serenaded
by many of the citizens of Washington, jubilant over
the defeat of the rebels at Gettysburg, the President acknowledged
the compliment thus:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Fellow-citizens</span>:&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;I am very glad indeed to see you to-night,
and yet I will not say I thank you for this call; but I
do most sincerely thank Almighty God for the occasion on
which you have called. How long ago is it&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;eighty odd
years&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;since, on the 4th of July, for the first time in the history
of the world, a nation, by its representatives, assembled
and declared as a self-evident truth, &#8216;that all men are created
equal?&#8217; That was the birthday of the United States of America.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
Since then, the 4th of July has had several very peculiar
recognitions. The two men most distinguished in the framing
and support of the Declaration, were Thomas Jefferson and
John Adams&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;the one having penned it, and the other sustained
it the most forcibly in debate&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;the only two, of the
fifty-five who signed it, who were elected Presidents of the
United States. Precisely fifty years after they put their
hands to the paper, it pleased Almighty God to take both
from this stage of action. This was indeed an extraordinary
and remarkable event in our history. Another President,
five years after, was called from this stage of existence on the
same day and month of the year; and now, on this last 4th
of July just passed, when we have a gigantic rebellion, at
the bottom of which is an effort to overthrow the principle
that all men were created equal, we have the surrender of a
most powerful position and army on that very day. And not
only so, but in a succession of battles in Pennsylvania, near
to us, through three days, so rapidly fought that they might
be called one great battle, on the 1st, 2d, and 3d of the month
of July, and on the 4th the cohorts of those who opposed the
declaration that all men are created equal, &#8216;turned tail&#8217; and
run. Gentlemen, this is a glorious theme, and the occasion
for a speech; but I am not prepared to make one worthy of
the occasion. I would like to speak in terms of praise due to
the many brave officers and soldiers who have fought in the
cause of the Union and liberties of their country from the
beginning of the war. These are trying occasions, not only
in success, but for the want of success. I dislike to mention
the name of one single officer, lest I might do wrong to those
I might forget. Recent events bring up glorious names, and
particularly prominent ones; but these I will not mention.
Having said this much, I will now take the music.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>The following letter, addressed to General Grant after the
capture of Vicksburg, gives an insight into the transparent
candor and frankness of the President.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sigright">
&#8220;<i>Executive Mansion</i>, Washington, July 13th, 1863.<br />
</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Major-General U.&nbsp;S. Grant</span>&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;<i>My Dear General</i>: I do
not remember that you and I ever met personally. I write
this now as a grateful acknowledgment of the almost inestimable
service you have done the country. I write to say
a word further. When you first reached the vicinity of
Vicksburg, I thought you should do what you finally did&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;march
the troops across the neck, run the batteries with the
transports, and thus go below; and I never had any faith,
except a general hope that you knew better than I, that the
Yazoo Pass expedition, and the like, could succeed. When
you got below, and took Port Gibson, Grand Gulf, and vicinity,
I thought you should go down the river and join General
Banks, and when you turned northward, east of the Big
Black, I feared it was a mistake. I now wish to make the
personal acknowledgment, that you were right and I was
wrong.</p>

<p class="sigright">

<p>The following was issued in commemoration of the victories
at Vicksburg, Port Hudson, and Gettysburg:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">By the President of the United States of America.&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;A
Proclamation.</span>&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;It has pleased Almighty God to hearken
to the supplications and prayers of an afflicted people, and to
vouchsafe to the Army and Navy of the United States, on the
land and on the sea, victories so signal and so effective as to
furnish reasonable grounds for augmented confidence that the
Union of these States will be maintained, their Constitution
preserved, and their peace and prosperity permanently
secured; but these victories have been accorded, not without
sacrifice of life, limb, and liberty, incurred by brave, patriotic,
and loyal citizens. Domestic affliction, in every part of the
country, follows in the train of these fearful bereavements.
It is meet and right to recognize and confess the presence of
the Almighty Father, and the power of his hand equally in
these triumphs and these sorrows.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
&#8220;Now, therefore, be it known, that I do set apart Thursday,
the 6th day of August next, to be observed as a day for
National Thanksgiving, praise, and prayer; and I invite the
people of the United States to assemble on that occasion in
their customary places of worship, and in the form approved
by their own consciences, render the homage due to the
Divine Majesty, for the wonderful things he has done in the
Nation&#8217;s behalf, and invoke the influence of his Holy Spirit,
to subdue the anger which has produced, and so long sustained,
a needless and cruel rebellion; to change the hearts
of the insurgents; to guide the counsels of the Government
with wisdom adequate to so great a National emergency, and
to visit with tender care, and consolation, throughout the
length and breadth of our land, all those who, through the
vicissitudes of marches, voyages, battles, and sieges, have
been brought to suffer in mind, body, or estate; and finally,
to lead the whole nation through paths of repentance and
submission to the Divine will, back to the perfect enjoyment
of union and fraternal peace.</p>

<p>&#8220;In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand, and
caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Done at the City of Washington, this fifteenth day of
July, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and
sixty-three, and of the Independence of the United States

&#8220;<span class="smcap">William H. Seward</span>, Secretary of State.&#8221;<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>The following letter, written in August, 1863, in answer
to an invitation to attend a meeting of unconditional Union
men held in Illinois, gives at length the President&#8217;s views
at that time on his Emancipation proclamation:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sigright">

&#8220;<span class="smcap">Executive Mansion</span>, Washington, August 26th, 1863.<br />
</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">My Dear Sir</span>:&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;Your letter inviting me to attend a mass
meeting of unconditional Union men, to be held at the capital
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>of Illinois on the third day of September, has been received.
It would be very agreeable to me thus to meet my old friends
at my own home; but I cannot just now be absent from this
city so long as a visit there would require. The meeting is
to be of all those who maintain unconditional devotion to the
Union; and I am sure that my old political friends will thank
me for tendering, as I do, the nation&#8217;s gratitude to those
other noble men whom no partisan malice or partisan hope
can make false to the nation&#8217;s life. There are those who are
dissatisfied with me. To such I would say:&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;You desire
peace, and you blame me that we do not have it. But how
can we attain it? There are but three conceivable ways:&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;First,
to suppress the rebellion by force of arms. This I am
trying to do. Are you for it? If you are, so far we are
agreed. If you are not for it, a second way is to give up the
Union. I am against this. If you are, you should say so,
plainly. If you are not for force, nor yet for dissolution, there
only remains some imaginable compromise. I do not believe
that any compromise embracing the maintenance of the Union
is now possible. All that I learn leads to a directly opposite
belief. The strength of the rebellion is its military&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;its
army. That army dominates all the country and all the
people within its range. Any offer of any terms made by
any man or men within that range in opposition to that army
is simply nothing for the present, because such man or men
have no power whatever to enforce their side of a compromise,
if one were made with them. To illustrate: Suppose
refugees from the South and peace men of the North
get together in convention, and frame and proclaim a compromise
embracing the restoration of the Union. In what
way can that compromise be used to keep General Lee&#8217;s
army out of Pennsylvania? General Meade&#8217;s army can keep
Lee&#8217;s army out of Pennsylvania, and I think can ultimately
drive it out of existence. But no paper compromise to which
the controllers of General Lee&#8217;s army are not agreed, can at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
all affect that army. In an effort at such compromise we
would waste time which the enemy would improve to our
disadvantage, and that would be all. A compromise, to be
effective, must be made either with those who control the
rebel army, or with the people, first liberated from the domination
of that army by the success of our army. Now, allow
me to assure you that no word or intimation from the rebel
army, or from any of the men controlling it, in relation to any
peace compromise, has ever come to my knowledge or belief.
All charges and intimations to the contrary are deceptive and
groundless. And I promise you that if any such propositions
shall hereafter come, it shall not be rejected and kept secret
from you. I freely acknowledge myself to be the servant of
the people, according to the bond of service, the United
States Constitution; and that, as such, I am responsible to
them. But, to be plain. You are dissatisfied with me about
the negro. Quite likely there is a difference of opinion between
you and myself upon that subject. I certainly wish
that all men could be free, while you, I suppose, do not. Yet
I have neither adopted nor proposed any measure which is
not consistent with even your view, provided you are for the
Union. I suggested compensated emancipation, to which
you replied that you wished not to be taxed to buy negroes.
But I have not asked you to be taxed to buy negroes, except
in such way as to save you from greater taxation, to save the
Union exclusively by other means.</p>

<p>&#8220;You dislike the emancipation proclamation, and perhaps
would have it retracted. You say it is unconstitutional. I
think differently. I think that the Constitution invests its
Commander-in-chief with the law of war in time of war. The
most that can be said, if so much, is, that the slaves are
property. Is there, has there ever been, any question that
by the law of war, property, both of enemies and friends, may
be taken when needed? And is it not needed whenever
taking it helps us or hurts the enemy? Armies, the world<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
over, destroy enemies&#8217; property when they cannot use it; and
even destroy their own to keep it from the enemy. Civilized
belligerents do all in their power to help themselves or hurt
the enemy, except a few things regarded as barbarous or
cruel. Among the exceptions are the massacre of vanquished
foes and non-combatants, male and female. But the proclamation,
as law, is valid or is not valid. If it is not valid
it needs no restriction. If it is valid it cannot be retracted,
any more than the dead can be brought to life. Some of you
profess to think that its retraction would operate favorably for
the Union. Why better after the retraction than before the
issue? There was more than a year and a half of trial to
suppress the rebellion before the proclamation was issued, the
last one hundred days of which passed under an explicit
notice, that it was coming unless averted by those in revolt
returning to their allegiance. The war has certainly progressed
as favorably for us since the issue of the proclamation
as before. I know as fully as one can know the opinions of
others, that some of the commanders of our armies in the
field, who have given us our most important victories, believe
the emancipation policy and the aid of colored troops constitute
the heaviest blows yet dealt to the rebellion, and that at
least one of those important successes could not have been
achieved when it was but for the aid of black soldiers.
Among the commanders holding these views are some who
have never had any affinity with what is called abolitionism
or with &#8216;republican party politics,&#8217; but who hold them
purely as military opinions. I submit their opinions as being
entitled to some weight against the objections often urged that
emancipation and arming the blacks are unwise as military
measures, and were not adopted as such in good faith. You
say that you will not fight to free negroes. Some of them
seem to be willing to fight for you&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;but no matter. Fight
you, then, exclusively to save the Union. I issued the proclamation
on purpose to aid you in saving the Union.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
Whenever you shall have conquered all resistance to the
Union, if I shall urge you to continue fighting, it will be an
apt time then for you to declare that you will not fight to free
negroes. I thought that in your struggle for the Union, to
whatever extent the negroes should cease helping the enemy,
to that extent it weakened the enemy in his resistance to you.
Do you think differently? I thought that whatever negroes
can be got to do as soldiers, leaves just so much less for white
soldiers to do in saving the Union. Does it appear otherwise
to you? But negroes, like other people, act upon motives.
Why should they do any thing for us if we will do nothing
for them? If they stake their lives for us they must be
prompted by the strongest motive, even the promise of freedom.
And the promise being made, must be kept. The signs
look better. The Father of Waters again goes unvexed to
the sea. Thanks to the great North-west for it. Nor yet
wholly to them. Three hundred miles up they met New
England, Empire, Keystone, and Jersey, hewing their way
right and left. The Sunny South, too, in more colors than
one, also lent a hand. On the spot, their part of the history
was jotted down in black and white. The joy was a great
national one, and let none be banned who bore an honorable
part in it; and, while those who have cleared the great river
may well be proud, even that is not all. It is hard to say
that any thing has been more bravely and better done than at
Antietam, Murfreesboro&#8217;, Gettysburg, and on many fields of
less note. Nor must Uncle Sam&#8217;s web feet be forgotten.
At all the waters&#8217; margins they have been present&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;not only
on the deep sea, the broad bay, and the rapid river, but also
up the narrow, muddy bayou; and wherever the ground was
a little damp they have been and made their tracks. Thanks
to all. For the great Republic&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;for the principles by which
it lives and keeps alive&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;for man&#8217;s vast future&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;thanks to all.
Peace does not appear so far distant as it did. I hope it will
come soon, and come to stay: and so come as to be worth the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
keeping in all future time. It will then have been proved that
among freemen there can be no successful appeal from the
ballot to the bullet, and that they who take such appeal are
sure to lose their case and pay the cost. And then there will
be some black men who can remember that, with silent
tongue, and clenched teeth, and steady eye, and well poised
bayonet, they have helped mankind on to this great consummation;
while I fear that there will be some white men unable
to forget that with malignant heart and deceitful speech
they have striven to hinder it. Still let us not be over sanguine
of a speedy final triumph. Let us be quite sober. Let
us diligently apply the means, never doubting that a just
God, in his own good time, will give us the rightful result.</p>

<p>Desirous of inaugurating the custom of setting apart each
year a common day throughout the land for thanksgiving and
prayer, Mr. Lincoln issued the following:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">By the President of the United States of America.&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;A
Proclamation</span>:&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;The year that is drawing towards its
close has been filled with the blessings of fruitful fields and
healthful skies. To these bounties, which are so constantly
enjoyed that we are prone to forget the source from which
they come, others have been added which are of so extraordinary
a nature that they can not fail to even penetrate and
soften the heart which is habitually insensible to the ever
watchful providence of Almighty God. In the midst of a
civil war of unequalled magnitude and severity, which has
sometimes seemed to invite and provoke the aggressions of
foreign States, peace has been preserved with all nations,
order has been maintained, the laws have been respected and
obeyed, and harmony has prevailed everywhere, except in
the theatre of military conflict. While that theatre has been
greatly contracted by the advancing armies and navies of the
Union, the needful diversion of wealth and strength from the
fields of peaceful industry to the national defence, has not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
arrested the plow, the shuttle, or the ship. The axe has
enlarged the borders of our settlements, and the mines, as
well of iron and coal as of the precious metals, have yielded
even more abundantly than heretofore. Population has
steadily increased, notwithstanding the waste that has been
made in the camp, the siege, and the battle-field; and the
country, rejoicing in the consciousness of augmented strength
and vigor, is permitted to expect a continuance of years, with
a large increase of freedom. No human counsel hath devised,
nor hath any mortal hand worked out these great things.
They are the gracious gifts of the Most High God, who,
while dealing with us in anger for our sins, hath nevertheless
remembered mercy.</p>

<p>&#8220;It hath seemed to me fit and proper that they should be
solemnly, devoutly, and gratefully acknowledged, as with one
heart and voice, by the whole American people. I do, therefore,
invite my fellow-citizens in every part of the United
States, and also those who are at sea, and those who are
sojourning in foreign lands, to set apart and observe the last
Thursday of November next as a day of thanksgiving and
prayer to our beneficent Father, who dwelleth in the heavens.
And I recommend to them that, while offering up the ascriptions
justly due to him for such signal deliverances and blessings,
they do also, with humble penitence for our National
perverseness and disobedience, commend to his tender care
all those who have become widows, orphans, mourners, or
sufferers, in the lamentable civil strife in which we are
unavoidably engaged, and fervently implore the interposition
of the Almighty hand to heal the wounds of the nation, and
to restore it, as soon as may be consistent with the Divine
purposes, to the full enjoyment of peace, harmony, tranquillity,
and union.</p>

<p>&#8220;In testimony whereof, I have hereunto set my hand, and
caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Done at the City of Washington, this, the third day of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
October, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred
and sixty-three, and of the Independence of the United States

<p>On the 19th of November, 1863, President Lincoln delivered
the following dedicatory address upon the occasion of consecrating
a National Cemetery at Gettysburg, for the secure
rest of those brave men who yielded up their lives in behalf
of their country during the three days&#8217; battle at that place:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;Fourscore and seven years ago our fathers brought forth
upon this continent a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and
dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.
Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether
that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can
long endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war.
We are met to dedicate a portion of it as the final resting-place
of those who here gave their lives that that nation
might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should
do this.</p>

<p>&#8220;But in a larger sense we can not dedicate, we can not
consecrate, we can not hallow this ground. The brave men,
living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it far
above our power to add or detract. The world will little
note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never
forget what they did here. It is for us, the living, rather to
be dedicated here to the unfinished work that they have thus
far so nobly carried on. It is rather for us to be here dedicated
to the great task remaining before us&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;that from these
honored dead we take increased devotion to the cause for
which they here gave the last full measure of devotion&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;that
we here highly resolve that the dead shall not have died in
vain, that the nation shall, under God, have a new birth of
freedom, and that the government of the people, by the
people, and for the people, shall not perish from the earth.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang">Organization of the House&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;Different Opinions as to Reconstruction&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;Provisions for Pardon
of Rebels&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;President&#8217;s Proclamation of Pardon&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;Annual Message&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;Explanatory
Proclamation.</p></blockquote>

<p>Upon the assembling of the Thirty-eighth Congress, December
7th, 1863&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;that Congress, in the lower branch of
which the Opposition had counted upon a majority&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;the supporters
of the Government found no difficulty in electing their
candidates for Speaker by a majority of twenty, nor a radical
anti-slavery man as Chaplain, albeit against the latter was
offered as candidate an Episcopalian Bishop, nameless here,
who had had the effrontery since the outbreak of the war to
appear before the public as a defender of the institution upon
Christian principles.</p>

<p>With the success of our arms&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;movements toward an organization
of the local governments in the States of Tennessee,
Louisiana, and Arkansas being in progress&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;the difficult
question as to the principles upon which such reorganization
should be effected presented itself for settlement.</p>

<p>Some took the ground that, by virtue of their rebellion, the
disloyal States had lapsed into mere territorial organizations,
and should remain in that condition until again admitted into
the Union.</p>

<p>Others contended that this would be, in effect, to recognise
secession, and maintained that, whatever might have been the
acts of the inhabitants of any State, the State as such still
constituted an integral member of the Union, entitled to all
privileges as such, whenever a sufficient number of loyal
citizens chose to exercise the right of suffrage&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;the General<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
Government seeing to it, as was its duty under the Constitution,
that a republican form was guarantied. As to
what number of loyal inhabitants should suffice, opinions
differed.</p>

<p>Congress had provided, by an act approved July 17, 1862:</p>

<p>That the President is hereby authorized, at any time hereafter,
by proclamation, to extend to persons who may have
participated in the existing rebellion in any State or part
thereof, pardon and amnesty, with such exceptions, and at
such time, and on such conditions, as he may deem expedient
for the public welfare.</p>

<p>In accordance with this authority, the following proclamation
was issued by Mr. Lincoln, by which it appeared he held
himself pledged, before the world and to the persons immediately
affected by it, to make an adherence to the policy of
emancipation, inaugurated by him, a condition precedent to
any act of clemency to be exercised by himself:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Whereas</span>, In and by the Constitution of the United
States, it is provided that the President &#8216;shall have power to
grant reprieves and pardons for offences against the United
States, except in cases of impeachment;&#8217; and whereas, a rebellion
now exists whereby the loyal State Governments of
several States have for a long time been subverted, and many
persons have committed and are now guilty of treason against
the United States; and whereas, with reference to said rebellion
and treason, laws have been enacted by Congress declaring
forfeitures and confiscation of property and liberation
of slaves, all upon terms and conditions therein stated; and
also declaring that the President was thereby authorized at
any time thereafter, by proclamation, to extend to persons
who may have participated in the existing rebellion, in any
State or part thereof, pardon and amnesty, with such exceptions
and at such times and on such conditions as he may
deem expedient for the public welfare; and whereas, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
Congressional declaration for limited and conditional pardon
accords with well-established judicial exposition of the pardoning
power; and whereas, with reference to said rebellion,
the President of the United States has issued several proclamations,
with provisions in regard to the liberation of slaves;
and whereas, it is now desired by some persons heretofore
engaged in said rebellion, to resume their allegiance to the
United States, and to reinaugurate loyal State Governments
within and for their respective States; therefore,</p>

<p>&#8220;I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, do
proclaim, declare, and make known to all persons who have,
directly or by implication, participated in the existing rebellion,
except as hereinafter excepted, that a full pardon is
hereby granted to them and each of them, with restoration of
all rights of property, except as to slaves, and in property
cases where rights of third parties shall have intervened, and
upon the condition that every such person shall take and
subscribe an oath, and thenceforward keep and maintain said
oath inviolate; and which oath shall be registered for permanent
preservation, and shall be of the tenor and effect
following, to wit:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I, &#8203;&mdash;&#8203;&mdash; &#8203;&mdash;&#8203;&mdash;, do solemnly swear, in presence of Almighty
God, that I will henceforth faithfully support, protect and
defend the Constitution of the United States, and the Union
of the States thereunder; and that I will, in like manner,
abide by and faithfully support all acts of Congress passed
during the existing rebellion with reference to slaves, so long
and so far as not repealed, modified, or held void by Congress,
or by decision of the Supreme Court; and that I will, in like
manner, abide by and faithfully support all proclamations of
the President made during the existing rebellion having
reference to slaves, so long and so far as not modified or
declared void by decision of the Supreme Court. So help me
God.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;The persons excepted from the benefits of the foregoing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
provisions are all who are, or shall have been, civil or diplomatic
officers or agents of the so-called Confederate Government;
all who have left judicial stations under the United
States to aid the rebellion; all who are, or shall have been,
military or naval officers of the said so-called Confederate
Government, above the rank of colonel in the army, or of lieutenant
in the navy; all who left seats in the United States
Congress to aid the rebellion; all who resigned commissions
in the Army or Navy of the United States, and afterward
aided the rebellion; and all who have engaged in any way in
treating colored persons, or white persons in charge of such,
otherwise than lawfully as prisoners of war, and which
persons may have been found in the United States service as
soldiers, seamen, or in any other capacity.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I do further proclaim, declare, and make known, that
whenever, in any of the States of Arkansas, Texas, Louisiana,
Mississippi, Tennessee, Alabama, Georgia, Florida, South
Carolina, and North Carolina, a number of persons, not less
than one-tenth in number of the votes cast in such State at
the Presidential election of the year of our Lord 1860, each
having taken the oath aforesaid, and not having since violated
it, and being a qualified voter by the election law of the State
existing immediately before the so-called act of secession, and
excluding all others, shall re-establish a State Government
which shall be republican, and in nowise contravening said
oath, such shall be recognized as the true Government of the
State, and the State shall receive thereunder the benefits of
the constitutional provision which declares that &#8216;the United
States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a republican
form of government, and shall protect each of them
against invasion; and on application of the Legislature, or
the Executive, (when the Legislature cannot be convened)
against domestic violence.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I do further proclaim, declare, and make known that
any provision which may be adopted by such State Government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
in relation to the freed people of such State, which shall
recognize and declare their permanent freedom, provide for
their education, and which may yet be consistent, as a
temporary arrangement, with their present condition as a
laboring, landless, and homeless class, will not be objected to
by the National Executive. And it is suggested as not improper,
that, in constructing a loyal State Government in any
State, the name of the State, the boundary, the subdivisions,
the Constitution, and the general code of laws, as before the
rebellion, be maintained, subject only to the modifications
made necessary by the conditions hereinbefore stated, and
such others, if any, not contravening said conditions, and
which may be deemed expedient by those framing the new
State Government.</p>

<p>&#8220;To avoid misunderstanding, it may be proper to say that
this proclamation, so far as it relates to State Governments,
has no reference to States wherein loyal State Governments
have all the while been maintained. And for the same reason,
it may be proper to further say that whether members sent to
Congress from any State shall be admitted to seats constitutionally,
rests exclusively with the respective Houses, and
not to any extent with the Executive. And still further, that
this proclamation is intended to present the people of the
States wherein the National authority has been suspended,
and loyal State Governments have been subverted, a mode in
and by which the National authority and loyal State Governments
may be re-established within said States, or in any of
them; and, while the mode presented is the best the Executive
can suggest, with his present impressions, it must not be
understood that no other possible mode would be acceptable.</p>

<p>&#8220;Given under my hand at the city of Washington, the eighth
day of December, A.&nbsp;D. 1863, and of the Independence of the
United States of America the eighty-eighth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
The Annual Message sent in to Congress on the 9th day
of December, omitting matters of but temporary interest&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;is
as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives</span>:&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;Another
year of health and sufficiently abundant
harvests, has passed. For these, and especially for the
improved condition of our National affairs, our renewed and
profoundest gratitude to God is due.</p>

<p>&#8220;We remain in peace and friendship with foreign powers.</p>

<p>&#8220;The efforts of disloyal citizens of the United States to
involve us in foreign wars, to aid an inexcusable insurrection,
have been unavailing. Her Britannic Majesty&#8217;s Government,
as was justly expected, have exercised their authority to prevent
the departure of new hostile expeditions from British
ports. The Emperor of France has, by a like proceeding,
promptly vindicated the neutrality which he proclaimed at
the beginning of the contest. Questions of great intricacy
and importance have arisen, out of the blockade and other
belligerent operations, between the Government and several
of the maritime powers, but they have been discussed, and,
as far as was possible, accommodated in a spirit of frankness,
justice, and mutual good will. It is especially gratifying
that our prize courts, by the impartiality of their adjudications,
have commanded the respect and confidence of maritime
powers.</p>

<p>&#8220;The supplementary treaty between the United States and
Great Britain for the suppression of the African slave-trade,
made on the 17th of February last, has been duly ratified,
and carried into execution. It is believed that, so far as
American ports and American citizens are concerned, that
inhuman and odious traffic has been brought to an end....</p>

<p>&#8220;Incidents occurring in the progress of our civil war have
forced upon my attention the uncertain state of international
questions touching the rights of foreigners in this country
and of United States citizens abroad. In regard to some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
Governments, these rights are at least partially defined
by treaties. In no instance, however, is it expressly stipulated
that, in the event of civil law, a foreigner residing
in this country, within the lines of the insurgents, is to
be exempted from the rule which classes him as a belligerent,
in whose behalf the Government of his country can not
expect any privileges or immunities distinct from that
character. I regret to say, however, that such claims have
been put forward, and, in some instances, in behalf of
foreigners who have lived in the United States the greater
part of their lives.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is reason to believe that many persons born
in foreign countries, who have declared their intention to
become citizens, or who have been fully naturalized, have
evaded the military duty required of them by denying the
fact, and thereby throwing upon the Government the burden
of proof. It has been found difficult or impracticable to
obtain this proof, from the want of guides to the proper
sources of information. These might be supplied by requiring
clerks of courts, where declarations of intention may be
made or naturalizations effected, to send, periodically, lists of
the names of the persons naturalized, or declaring their intention
to become citizens, to the Secretary of the Interior, in
whose Department those names might be arranged and
printed for general information.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is also reason to believe that foreigners frequently
become citizens of the United States for the sole purpose of
evading duties imposed by the laws of their native countries,
to which, on becoming naturalized here, they at once repair,
and, though never returning to the United States, they
still claim the interposition of this Government as citizens.
Many altercations and great prejudices have heretofore arisen
out of this abuse. It is, therefore, submitted to your serious
consideration. It might be advisable to fix a limit, beyond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
which no citizen of the United States residing abroad
may claim the interposition of his Government.</p>

<p>&#8220;The right of suffrage has often been assumed and exercised
by aliens, under pretences of naturalization, which they
have disavowed when drafted into the military service.
I submit the expediency of such an amendment of the law as
will make the fact of voting an estoppel against any plea of
exemption from military service, or other civil obligation, on
the ground of alienage....</p>

<p>&#8220;The condition of the several organized Territories is
generally satisfactory, although Indian disturbances in New
Mexico have not been entirely suppressed. The mineral
resources of Colorado, Nevada, Idaho, New Mexico, and
Arizona, are proving far richer than has been heretofore
understood. I lay before you a communication on this subject
from the Governor of New Mexico. I again submit to
your consideration the expediency of establishing a system
for the encouragement of immigration. Although this source
of national wealth and strength is again flowing with greater
freedom than for several years before the insurrection occurred,
there is still a great deficiency of laborers in every field of
industry, especially in agriculture and in our mines, as well
of iron and coal as of the precious metals. While the
demand for labor is thus increased here, tens of thousands of
persons, destitute of remunerative occupation, are thronging
our foreign consulates, and offering to emigrate to the
United States if essential, but very cheap, assistance can be
afforded them. It is easy to see that, under the sharp discipline
of civil war, the nation is beginning a new life. This
noble effort demands the aid, and ought to receive the attention
and support, of the Government.</p>

<p>&#8220;Injuries, unforeseen by the Government and unintended,
may, in some cases, have been inflicted on the subjects
or citizens of foreign countries, both at sea and on land,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
by persons in the service of the United States. As this
Government expects redress from other powers when similar
injuries are inflicted by persons in their service upon citizens
of the United States, we must be prepared to do justice
to foreigners. If the existing judicial tribunals are inadequate
to this purpose, a special court may be authorized, with
power to hear and decide such claims of the character
referred to as may have arisen under treaties and the public
law. Conventions for adjusting the claims by joint commission,
have been proposed to some Governments, but no definite
answer to the propositions has yet been received from
any.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the course of the session, I shall probably have occasion
to request you to provide indemnification to claimants
where decrees of restitution have been rendered, and damages
awarded by admiralty courts, and in other cases, where this
Government may be acknowledged to be liable in principle,
and where the amount of that liability has been ascertained
by an informal arbitration.</p>

<p>&#8220;The proper officers of the Treasury have deemed themselves
required, by the law of the United States upon the
subject, to demand a tax upon the incomes of foreign consuls
in this country. While such demand may not, in strictness,
be in derogation of public law, or perhaps of any existing
treaty between the United States and a foreign country, the
expediency of so far modifying the act as to exempt from tax
the income of such consuls as are not citizens of the United
States, derived from the emoluments of their office, or from
property not situated in the United States, is submitted
to your serious consideration. I make this suggestion upon
the ground that a comity which ought to be reciprocated
exempts our consuls, in all other countries, from taxation to
the extent thus indicated. The United States, I think, ought
not to be exceptionally illiberal to international trade and
commerce.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
&#8220;The operations of the Treasury during the last year have
been successfully conducted. The enactment by Congress of
a National Banking Law has proved a valuable support
of the public credit; and the general legislation in relation to
loans has fully answered the expectations of its favorers.
Some amendments may be required to perfect existing laws;
but no change in their principles or general scope is believed
to be needed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Since these measures have been in operation, all demands
on the Treasury, including the pay of the Army and Navy,
have been promptly met and fully satisfied. No considerable
body of troops, it is believed, were ever more amply provided
and more liberally and punctually paid; and it may be
added that by no people were the burdens incident to a great
war ever more cheerfully borne.</p>

<p>&#8220;The receipts during the year from all sources, including
loans and the balance in the Treasury at its commencement,
were $901,125,674 86, and the aggregate disbursements,
$895,796,630 65, leaving a balance on the 1st of July, 1863,
of $5,329,044 21. Of the receipts there were derived
from customs, $69,059,642 40; from internal revenue,
$37,640,787 95; from direct tax, $1,485,103 61; from lands,
$167,617 17; from miscellaneous sources, $3,046,615 35;
and from loans, $776,682,361 57; making the aggregate,
$901,125,674 86. Of the disbursements, there were, for the
civil service, $23,253,922 08; for pensions and Indians,
$4,216,520 79; for interest on public debt, $24,729,846 51;
for the War Department, $599,298,600 83; for the Navy
department, $63,211,105 27; for payment of funded and
temporary debt, $181,086,635 07; making the aggregate,
$895,796,630 65; and leaving the balance of $5,329,044 21.
But the payment of funded and temporary debt, having been
made from moneys borrowed during the year, must be
regarded as merely nominal payments, and the moneys
borrowed to make them as merely nominal receipts; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
their amount, $181,086,635 07, should therefore be deducted
both from receipts and disbursements. This being done,
there remain as actual receipts, $720,039,039 79; and the
actual disbursements, $714,709,995 58, leaving the balance
as already stated.</p>

<p>&#8220;The actual receipts and disbursements for the first quarter,
and the estimated receipts and disbursements for the remaining
three-quarters, of the current fiscal year 1864, will
be shown in detail by the report of the Secretary of the
Treasury, to which I invite your attention. It is sufficient to
say here that it is not believed that actual results will exhibit
a state of the finances less favorable to the country than the
estimates of that officer heretofore submitted; while it is
confidently expected that at the close of the year both disbursements
and debt will be found very considerably less
than has been anticipated.</p>

<p>&#8220;The report of the Secretary of War is a document of
great interest. It consists <span class="locked">of&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;1. The military operations of the year, detailed in the
report of the General-in-Chief.</p>

<p>&#8220;2. The organization of colored persons into the war
service.</p>

<p>&#8220;3. The exchange of prisoners, fully set forth in the letter
of General Hitchcock.</p>

<p>&#8220;4. The operations under the act for enrolling and calling
out the National forces, detailed in the report of the Provost
Marshal General.</p>

<p>&#8220;5. The organization of the Invalid Corps; and,</p>

<p>&#8220;6. The operation of the several departments of the Quartermaster
General, Commissary General, Paymaster General,
Chief of Engineers, Chief of Ordnance, and Surgeon General.</p>

<p>&#8220;It has appeared impossible to make a valuable summary
of this report, except such as would be too extended for this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
place, and hence I content myself by asking your careful
attention to the report itself.</p>

<p>&#8220;The duties devolving on the Naval branch of the service
during the year, and throughout the whole of this unhappy
contest, have been discharged with fidelity and eminent success.
The extensive blockade has been constantly increasing
in efficiency, and the Navy has expanded; yet on so long a
line it has so far been impossible to entirely suppress illicit
trade. From returns received at the Navy Department, it
appears that more than one thousand vessels have been captured
since the blockade was instituted, and that the value of
prizes already sent in for adjudication, amounts to over thirteen
million dollars.</p>

<p>&#8220;The naval force of the United States consists, at this time,
of five hundred and eighty-eight vessels, completed and in the
course of completion, and of these seventy-five are iron-clad or
armored steamers. The events of the war give an increased
interest and importance to the Navy, which will probably extend
beyond the war itself.</p>

<p>&#8220;The armored vessels in our Navy, completed and in service,
or which are under contract and approaching completion,
are believed to exceed in number those of any other Power.
But while these may be relied upon for harbor defence and
coast service, others, of greater strength and capacity, will be
necessary for cruising purposes, and to maintain our rightful
position on the ocean.</p>

<p>&#8220;The change that has taken place in naval vessels and
naval warfare since the introduction of steam as a motive
power for ships-of-war, demands either a corresponding
change in some of our existing navy-yards, or the establishment
of new ones, for the construction and necessary repairs
of modern naval vessels. No inconsiderable embarrassment,
delay, and public injury have been experienced from the want
of such Governmental establishments. The necessity of such
a navy-yard, so furnished, at some suitable place upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
Atlantic seaboard, has, on repeated occasions, been brought
to the attention of Congress by the Navy Department, and is
again presented in the report of the Secretary which accompanies
this communication. I think it my duty to invite your
special attention to this subject, and also to that of establishing
a yard and depot for naval purposes upon one of the Western
rivers. A naval force has been created on those interior
waters, and under many disadvantages, within little more than
two years, exceeding in numbers the whole naval force of the
country at the commencement of the present Administration.
Satisfactory and important as have been the performances of
the heroic men of the Navy at this interesting period, they are
scarcely more wonderful than the success of our mechanics
and artisans in the production of war vessels, which has
created a new form of naval power.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our country has advantages superior to any other nation
in our resources of iron and timber, with inexhaustible quantities
of fuel in the immediate vicinity of both, and all available
and in close proximity to navigable waters. Without
the advantage of public works, the resources of the nation
have been developed, and its power displayed, in the construction
of a navy of such magnitude, which has, at
the very period of its creation, rendered signal service to the
Union.</p>

<p>&#8220;The increase of the number of seamen in the public service,
from seven thousand five hundred men in the spring of
1861, to about thirty-four thousand at the present time, has
been accomplished without special legislation or extraordinary
bounties to promote that increase. It has been found, however,
that the operation of the draft, with the high bounties
paid for army recruits, is beginning to affect injuriously the
naval service, and will, if not corrected, be likely to impair its
efficiency, by detaching seamen from their proper vocation
and inducing them to enter the army. I therefore respectfully
suggest that Congress might aid both the army and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
naval services by a definite provision on this subject, which
would at the same time be equitable to the communities more
especially interested.</p>

<p>&#8220;I commend to your consideration the suggestions of the
Secretary of the Navy in regard to the policy of fostering and
training seamen, and also the education of officers and engineers
for the naval service. The Naval Academy is rendering
signal service in preparing midshipmen for the highly responsible
duties which in after-life they will be required to
perform. In order that the country should not be deprived
of the proper quota of educated officers for which legal provision
has been made at the Naval School, the vacancies
caused by the neglect or omission to make nominations from
the States in insurrection have been filled by the Secretary of
the Navy. The school is now more full and complete than at
any former period, and in every respect entitled to the favorable
consideration of Congress.</p>

<p>&#8220;During the past fiscal year the financial condition of the
Post Office Department has been one of increasing prosperity,
and I am gratified in being able to state that the actual postal
revenue has nearly equaled the entire expenditures; the
latter amounting to $11,314,206 84, and the former to
$11,163,789 59, leaving a deficiency of but $150,411 25. In
1860, the year immediately preceding the rebellion, the deficiency
amounted to $5,656,705 49, the postal receipts of
that year being $2,645,722 19 less than those of 1863. The
decrease since 1860 in the annual amount of transportation
has been only about twenty-five per cent., but the annual expenditure
on account of the same has been reduced thirty-five
per cent. It is manifest, therefore, that the Post Office
Department may become self-sustaining in a few years, even
with the restoration of the whole service.</p>

<p>&#8220;The quantity of land disposed of during the last and the
first quarter of the present fiscal years was 3,841,549 acres,
of which 161,911 acres were sold for cash, 1,456,514 acres<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
were taken up under the homestead law, and the residue disposed
of under laws granting lands for military bounties, for
railroad and other purposes. It also appears that the sale of
public lands is largely on the increase.</p>

<p>&#8220;It has long been a cherished opinion of some of our wisest
statesmen that the people of the United States had a higher
and more enduring interest in the early settlement and substantial
cultivation of the public lands than in the amount of
direct revenue to be derived from the sale of them. This
opinion has had a controlling influence in shaping legislation
upon the subject of our National domain. I may cite, as
evidence of this, the liberal measures adopted in reference to
actual settlers; the grants to the States of the overflowed
lands within their limits; in order to their being reclaimed
and rendered fit for cultivation; the grants to railway companies
of alternate sections of land upon the contemplated
lines of their roads, which, when completed, will so largely
multiply the facilities for reaching our distant possessions.
This policy has received its most signal and beneficent illustration
in the recent enactment granting homesteads to actual
settlers. Since the 1st day of January last, the before-mentioned
quantity of 1,456,514 acres of land have been taken up
under its provisions. This fact and the amount of sales furnish
gratifying evidence of increasing settlement upon the
public lands, notwithstanding the great struggle in which the
energies of the Nation have been engaged, and which has required
so large a withdrawal of our citizens from their accustomed
pursuits.</p>

<p>&#8220;The measures provided at your last session for the removal
of certain Indian tribes, have been carried into effect.
Sundry treaties have been negotiated which will, in due
time, be submitted for the constitutional action of the Senate.
They contain stipulations for extinguishing the possessory
rights of the Indians to large and valuable tracts of lands.
It is hoped that the effect of these treaties will result in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
establishment of permanent friendly relations with such of
these tribes as have been brought into frequent and bloody
collision with our outlying settlements and emigrants. Sound
policy and our imperative duty to these wards of the Government
demand our anxious and constant attention to their
material well-being, to their progress in the arts of civilization,
and above all, to that moral training which, under the
blessing of Divine Providence, will confer upon them the
elevated and sanctifying influences, the hopes and consolations
of the Christian faith.</p>

<p>&#8220;When Congress assembled a year ago, the war had
already lasted nearly twenty months; and there had been
many conflicts on both land and sea, with varying results.
The rebellion had been pressed back into reduced limits; yet
the tone of public feeling and opinion, at home and abroad,
was not satisfactory. With other signs, the popular elections,
then just past, indicated uneasiness among ourselves,
while, amid much that was cold and menacing, the kindest
words coming from Europe were uttered in accents of pity
that we were too blind to surrender a hopeless cause. Our
commerce was suffering greatly by a few armed vessels built
upon and furnished from foreign shores; and we were threatened
with such additions from the same quarter as would
sweep our trade from the sea and raise our blockade. We
had failed to elicit from European Governments any thing
hopeful upon this subject. The preliminary Emancipation
Proclamation, issued in September, was running its assigned
period to the beginning of the new year. A month later the
final proclamation came, including the announcement that
colored men of suitable condition would be received into the
war service. The policy of emancipation, and of employing
black soldiers, gave to the future a new aspect, about which
hope, and fear, and doubt contended in uncertain conflict.
According to our political system, as a matter of civil administration,
the General Government had no lawful power to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
effect emancipation in any State; and for a long time it had
been hoped that the rebellion could be suppressed without
resorting to it as a military measure. It was all the while
deemed possible that the necessity for it might come, and
that, if it should, the crisis of the contest would then be presented.
It came, and as was anticipated, it was followed by
dark and doubtful days. Eleven months having now passed,
we are permitted to take another review. The rebel borders
are pressed still further back, and by the complete opening
of the Mississippi the country dominated by the rebellion is
divided into distinct parts, with no practical communication
between them. Tennessee and Arkansas have been substantially
cleared of insurgent control, and influential citizens in
each, owners of slaves and advocates of slavery at the beginning
of the rebellion, now declare openly for emancipation
in their respective States. Of those States not included in
the Emancipation Proclamation, Maryland and Missouri,
neither of which, three years ago, would tolerate any restraint
upon the extension of slavery into new Territories, only dispute
now as to the best mode of removing it within their own
limits.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of those who were slaves at the beginning of the rebellion,
full one hundred thousand are now in the United States military
service, about one-half of which number actually bear
arms in the ranks; thus giving the double advantage of taking
so much labor from the insurgent cause, and supplying the
places which otherwise must be filled with so many white
men. So far as tested, it is difficult to say they are not as
good soldiers as any. No servile insurrection, or tendency
to violence or cruelty, has marked the measures of emancipation
and arming the blacks. These measures have been much
discussed in foreign countries, and contemporary with such
discussion the tone of public sentiment there is much improved.
At home the same measures have been fully discussed,
supported, criticised, and denounced, and the annual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
elections following are highly encouraging to those whose
official duty it is to bear the country through this great trial.
Thus we have the new reckoning. The crisis which threatened
to divide the friends of the Union is past.</p>

<p>&#8220;Looking now to the present and future, and with reference
to a resumption of the National authority within the States
wherein that authority has been suspended, I have thought
fit to issue a proclamation, a copy of which is herewith transmitted.
On examination of this proclamation it will appear,
as is believed, that nothing is attempted beyond what is
amply justified by the Constitution. True, the form of an
oath is given, but no man is coerced to take it. The man is
only promised a pardon in case he voluntarily takes the oath.
The Constitution authorizes the Executive to grant or withhold
the pardon at his own absolute discretion; and this
includes the power to grant on terms, as is fully established
by judicial and other authorities.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is also proffered that if, in any of the States named, a
State Government shall be, in the mode prescribed, set up,
such Government shall be recognized and guarantied by the
United States, and that under it the State shall, on the constitutional
conditions, be protected against invasion and domestic
violence. The constitutional obligation of the United
States to guarantee to every State in the Union a republican
form of government, and to protect the State, in the cases
stated, is explicit and full. But why tender the benefits of
this provision only to a State Government set up in this particular
way? This section of the Constitution contemplates
a case wherein the element within a State favorable to republican
government, in the Union, may be too feeble for an
opposite and hostile element external to or even within the
State; and such are precisely the cases with which we are
now dealing.</p>

<p>&#8220;An attempt to guarantee and protect a revived State
Government, constructed in whole, or in preponderating part,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
from the very element against whose hostility and violence it
is to be protected, is simply absurd. There must be a test
by which to separate the opposing element, so as to build
only from the sound; and that test is a sufficiently liberal
one, which accepts as sound whoever will make a sworn recantation
of his former unsoundness.</p>

<p>&#8220;But if it be proper to require, as a test of admission to the
political body, an oath of allegiance to the Constitution of the
United States, and to the Union under it, why also to the
laws and proclamations in regard to slavery? Those laws
and proclamations were enacted and put forth for the purpose
of aiding in the suppression of the rebellion. To give them
their fullest effect, there had to be a pledge for their maintenance.
In my judgment they have aided, and will further
aid, the cause for which they were intended. To now abandon
them would be not only to relinquish a lever of power,
but would also be a cruel and an astounding breach of faith.
I may add at this point that, while I remain in my present
position, I shall not attempt to retract or modify the Emancipation
Proclamation; nor shall I return to slavery any
person who is free by the terms of that proclamation, or by
any of the acts of Congress. For these and other reasons, it
is thought best that support of these measures shall be
included in the oath; and it is believed the Executive may
lawfully claim it in return for pardon and restoration of forfeited
rights, which he has clear constitutional power to
withhold altogether, or grant upon the terms which he shall
deem wisest for the public interest. It should be observed,
also, that this part of the oath is subject to the modifying
and abrogating power of legislation and supreme judicial
decision.</p>

<p>&#8220;The proposed acquiescence of the National Executive in
any reasonable temporary State arrangement for the freed
people, is made with the view of possibly modifying the confusion
and destitution which must, at best, attend all classes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
by a total revolution of labor throughout whole States. It
is hoped that the already deeply afflicted people in those
States may be somewhat more ready to give up the cause of
their affliction, if, to this extent, this vital matter be left to
themselves; while no power of the National Executive to
prevent an abuse, is abridged by the proposition.</p>

<p>&#8220;The suggestion in the proclamation as to maintaining the
political framework of the States on what is called reconstruction,
is made in the hope that it may do good without
danger of harm. It will save labor, and avoid great confusion.</p>

<p>&#8220;But why any proclamation now upon this subject? This
question is beset with the conflicting views that the step
might be delayed too long or be taken too soon. In some
States the elements for resumption seem ready for action, but
remain inactive, apparently for want of a rallying point&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;a
plan of action. Why shall A adopt the plan of B, rather
than B that of A? And if A and B should agree, how can
they know but that the General Government here will reject
their plan? By the proclamation a plan is presented which
may be accepted by them as a rallying point, and which
they are assured in advance will not be rejected here. This
may bring them to act sooner than they otherwise would.</p>

<p>&#8220;The objection to a premature presentation of a plan by
the National Executive consists in the danger of committals
on points which could be more safely left to further developments.
Care has been taken to so shape the document as
to avoid embarrassment from this source. Saying that, on
certain terms, certain classes will be pardoned, with rights
restored, it is not said that other classes or other terms will
never be included. Saying that reconstruction will be
accepted, if presented in a specific way, it is not said it will
never be accepted in any other way.</p>

<p>&#8220;The movements, by State action, for emancipation in
several of the States, not included in the Emancipation Proclamation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
are matters of profound congratulation. And
while I do not repeat in detail what I have heretofore so
earnestly urged upon this subject, my general views and feelings
remain unchanged; and I trust that Congress will omit
no fair opportunity of aiding these important steps to a great
consummation.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the midst of other cares, however important, we must
not lose sight of the fact that the war power is still our main
reliance. To that power alone can we look, yet for a time,
to give confidence to the people in the contested regions that
the insurgent power will not again overrun them. Until that
confidence shall be established, little can be done anywhere
for what is called reconstruction. Hence our chiefest care
must still be directed to the Army and Navy, who have thus
far borne their harder part so nobly and well. And it may
be esteemed fortunate that in giving the greatest efficiency to
these indispensable arms, we do also honorably recognize the
gallant men, from commander to sentinel, who compose them,
and, to whom, more than to others, the world must stand indebted
for the home of freedom disenthralled, regenerated, enlarged,
and perpetuated.</p>

<p>Dec. 8, 1863.      <span class="right">&#8220;Abraham Lincoln.&#8221;</span><br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>On the twenty-sixth of March, 1864, the following proclamation,
explanatory of the one issued on the eighth of
December, 1863, was published:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Whereas</span>, It has become necessary to define the cases in
which insurgent enemies are entitled to the benefits of the
Proclamation of the President of the United States, which
was made on the 8th day of December, 1863, and the manner
in which they shall proceed to avail themselves of these
benefits;</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">And whereas</span>, The objects of that proclamation were to
suppress the insurrection and to restore the authority of the
United States;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">And whereas</span>, The amnesty therein proposed by the
President was offered with reference to these objects alone;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the
United States, do hereby proclaim and declare that the said
proclamation does not apply to the cases of persons who, at
the time when they seek to obtain the benefits thereof, by
taking the oath thereby prescribed, are in military, naval or
civil confinement or custody, or under bonds or on parole of
the civil, military or naval authorities or agents of the United
States, as prisoners of war, or persons detained for offences
of any kind, either before or after conviction; and that on the
contrary, it does apply only to those persons who, being at
large and free from any arrest, confinement or duress, shall
voluntarily come forward and take the said oath, with the
purpose of restoring peace and establishing the national authority.</p>

<p>&#8220;Prisoners excluded from the amnesty offered in the said
proclamation may apply to the President for clemency, like
all other offenders, and their application will receive due consideration.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do further declare and proclaim that the oath prescribed
in the aforesaid proclamation of the 8th of December, 1863,
may be taken and subscribed to before any commanding
officer, civil, military or naval, in the service of the United
States, or any civil or military officer of a State or Territory
not in insurrection, who, by the laws thereof, may be qualified
for administering oaths.</p>

<p>&#8220;All officers who receive such oaths are hereby authorized
to give certificates thereon to the persons respectively by
whom they are made, and such officers are hereby required to
transmit the original records of such oaths at as early a day
as may be convenient to the Department of State, where they
will be deposited and remain in the archives of the Government.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Secretary of State will keep a register thereof, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
will, on application, in proper cases, issue certificates of such
records in the customary form of official certificates.</p>

<p>&#8220;In testimony whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and
caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Done at the city of Washington, this twenty-sixth day of
March, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred
and sixty-four, and of the Independence of the United States
the eighty-eighth.</p>

<p>On the night of the eighteenth of March, 1864, in response
to a call from the multitude at a fair held in the Patent
Office at Washington, in aid of an organization for the relief
of Union soldiers everywhere, Mr. Lincoln spoke as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Ladies and Gentlemen</span>:&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;I appear, to say but a word.
This extraordinary war in which we are engaged falls heavily
upon all classes of people, but the most heavily upon the
soldier. For it has been said, &#8216;All that a man hath will he
give for his life;&#8217; and, while all contribute of their substance,
the soldier puts his life at stake, and often yields it up in his
country&#8217;s cause. The highest merit, then, is due to the
soldier.</p>

<p>&#8220;In this extraordinary war, extraordinary developments
have manifested themselves, such as have not been seen in
former wars; and among these manifestations nothing has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
been more remarkable than these fairs for the relief of suffering
soldiers and their families. And the chief agents in these
fairs are the women of America. I am not accustomed to
the use of the language of eulogy; I have never studied the
art of paying compliments to women; but I must say, that,
if all that has been said by orators and poets, since the creation
of the world, in praise of women, were applied to the
women of America, it would not do them justice for their
conduct during this war. I will close by saying, God bless
the women of America!&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Three days later, a committee appointed by the Workingmen&#8217;s
Democratic Republican Association of New York
waited on the President, and presented him with an address
informing him that he had been elected a member of that
organization. After the chairman had stated the object of
the visit, Mr. Lincoln made the following reply:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Gentlemen of the Committee</span>:&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;The honorary membership
in your Association so generously tendered is gratefully
accepted. You comprehend, as your address shows, that the
existing rebellion means more and tends to more than the
perpetuation of African slavery&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;that it is, in fact, a war
upon the rights of all working people. Partly to show that
the view has not escaped my attention, and partly that I cannot
better express myself, I read a passage from the message
to Congress in December, 1861:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;It continues to develop that the insurrection is largely,
if not exclusively, a war upon the first principle of popular
government&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;the rights of the people. Conclusive evidence
of this is found in the most grave and maturely considered
public documents, as well as in the general tone of the insurgents.
In those documents we find the abridgement of
the existing right of suffrage, and the denial to the people of
all right to participate in the selection of public officers, except
the legislative body, boldly advocated with labored<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
arguments, to prove that large control of the people in government
is the source of all political evil. Monarchy is
sometimes hinted at as a possible refuge from the power of
the people. In my present position, I could scarcely be justified
were I to omit raising my voice against this approach
of returning despotism.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;It is not needed or fitting here that a general argument
should be made in favor of popular institutions; but there is
one point, with its connections, not so hackneyed as most
others, to which I ask a brief attention. It is the effort to
place <i>capital</i> on an equal footing with, if not above, <i>labor</i> in
the structure of the Government. It is assumed that labor is
available only in connection with capital; that nobody labors
unless somebody else owning capital somehow, by use of it,
induces him to labor.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;This assumed, it is next considered whether it is best
that capital shall <i>hire</i> laborers, and thus induce them to work
by their own consent, or <i>buy them</i> and drive them to it without
their consent. Having proceeded so far, it is naturally
concluded that all laborers are either hired laborers or what
we call slaves. And, further, it is assumed that whoever is
once a hired laborer is fixed in that condition for life. Now
there is no such relation between capital and labor as assumed,
nor is there any such thing as a free man being fixed
for life in the condition of a hired laborer. Both of these
assumptions are false, and all inferences from them are
groundless.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Labor is prior to and independent of capital. Capital is
only the fruit of labor, and never could have existed if labor
had not first existed. Labor is the support of capital, and
deserves much the higher consideration. Capital has its
rights, which are as worthy of protection as any other rights.
Nor is it denied that there is, and probably always will be, a
relation between labor and capital producing mutual benefits.
The error is in assuming that the whole labor of a community<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
exists within that relation. A few men own capital, and that
few avoid labor themselves, and with that capital hire or buy
another few to labor for them.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;A large majority belong to neither class&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;neither work
for others nor have others working for them. In most of the
Southern States a majority of the whole people, of all colors,
are neither slaves nor masters, while, in the Northern States,
a large majority are neither hirers nor hired. Men with their
families&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;wives, sons, and daughters&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;work for themselves
on their farms, in their houses, and in their shops, taking the
whole product to themselves, and asking no favors of capital
on the one hand nor of hired laborers or slaves on the other.
It is not forgotten that a considerable number of persons
mingle their own labor with capital&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;that is, they labor with
their own hands and also buy or hire others to labor for them;
but this is only a mixed and not a distinct class. No principle
stated is disturbed by the existence of this mixed class.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Again. As has already been said, there is not of necessity
any such thing as the free hired laborer being fixed to
that condition for life. Many independent men everywhere
in these States, a few years back in their lives, were hired
laborers. The prudent, penniless beginner in the world
labors for wages awhile, saves a surplus with which to buy
tools or lands for himself, then labors on his own account another
while, and at length hires another new beginner to help
him. This is the just, and generous, and prosperous system
which opens the way to all&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;gives hope to all, and consequent
energy, and progress, and improvement to all. No
men living are more worthy to be trusted than those who toil
up from poverty&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;none less inclined to take or touch
aught which they have not honestly earned. Let them beware
of surrendering a political power which they already
possess, and which, if surrendered, will surely be used to
close the door of advancement against such as they, and to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
fix new disabilities and burdens upon them till all of liberty
shall be lost.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;The views then expressed remain unchanged&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;nor have I
much to add. None are so deeply interested to resist the
present rebellion as the working people. Let them beware
of prejudices working disunion and hostility among themselves.
The most notable feature of a disturbance in your
city last summer, was the hanging of some working people
by other working people. It should never be so. The
strongest bond of human sympathy, outside of the family relation,
should be one uniting all working people, of all
nations, tongues, and kindreds. Nor should this lead to
a war upon property or the owners of property. Property
is the fruit of labor; property is desirable; is a positive good
in the world. That some should be rich, shows that others
may become rich, and hence is just encouragement to industry
and enterprise. Let not him who is houseless pull down the
house of another, but let him labor diligently and build one
for himself; thus, by example, assuring that his own shall be
safe from violence when built.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>And in Baltimore&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;that Baltimore through which, in
February, 1861, he had been compelled to pass by stealth, to
avoid the assassin, on his way to his inauguration&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;on the
18th of April, 1864, the anniversary eve of that murder
of loyal citizens armed in defence of their imperilled country&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;Mr.
Lincoln spoke at a similar Fair, and spoke, too, of
slavery, as of an institution practically annihilated in Maryland.</p>

<p>Truly some advance had been made during those three
years, so pregnant with events!</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Ladies and Gentlemen</span>:&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;Calling it to mind that we are
in Baltimore, we cannot fail to note that the world moves.
Looking upon the many people I see assembled here to serve
as they best may the soldiers of the Union, it occurs to me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
that three years ago those soldiers could not pass through
Baltimore. I would say, blessings upon the men who have
wrought these changes, and the ladies who have assisted
them. This change which has taken place in Baltimore, is
part only of a far wider change that is taking place all over
the country.</p>

<p>&#8220;When the war commenced, three years ago, no one
expected that it would last this long, and no one supposed
that the institution of slavery would be materially affected by
it. But here we are. The war is not yet ended, and
slavery has been very materially affected or interfered with.
So true is it that man proposes and God disposes.</p>

<p>&#8220;The world is in want of a good definition of the word
liberty. We all declare ourselves to be for liberty, but we do
not all mean the same thing. Some mean that a man can do
as he pleases with himself and his property. With others,
it means that some men can do as they please with other
men and other men&#8217;s labor. Each of these things are called
liberty, although they are entirely different. To give an
illustration: A shepherd drives the wolf from the throat of
his sheep when attacked by him, and the sheep, of course,
thanks the shepherd for the preservation of his life; but the
wolf denounces him as despoiling the sheep of his liberty&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;especially
if it be a black sheep.</p>

<p>&#8220;This same difference of opinion prevails among some of
the people of the North. But the people of Maryland have
recently been doing something to properly define the meaning
of the word, and I thank them from the bottom of my heart
for what they have done and are doing.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not very becoming for a President to make a speech
at great length, but there is a painful rumor afloat in the
country, in reference to which a few words shall be said. It
is reported that there has been a wanton massacre of some
hundreds of colored soldiers at Fort Pillow, Tennessee,
during a recent engagement there, and it is fit to explain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
some facts in relation to the affair. It is said by some
persons that the Government is not, in this matter, doing its
duty. At the commencement of the war, it was doubtful
whether black men would be used as soldiers or not. The
matter was examined into very carefully, and after mature
deliberation, the whole matter resting as it were with himself,
he, in his judgment, decided that they should.</p>

<p>&#8220;He was responsible for the act to the American people,
to a Christian nation, to the future historian, and above all,
to his God, to whom he would have, one day, to render
an account of his stewardship. He would now say that
in his opinion the black soldier should have the same protection
as the white soldier, and he would have it. It was an
error to say that the Government was not acting in the
matter. The Government has no direct evidence to confirm
the reports in existence relative to this massacre, but he himself
believed the facts in relation to it to be as stated. When
the Government does know the facts from official sources, and
they prove to substantiate the reports, retribution will be
surely given.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. Lincoln&#8217;s policy upon the question of slavery, is
tersely presented in the following letter written by him to a
Kentuckian, dated Executive Mansion, Washington, April 4,
1864.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">
&#8220;<span class="smcap">A.&nbsp;G. Hodges, Esq.</span>, Frankfort, Ky.:<br />
</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">My Dear Sir</span>:&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;You ask me to put in writing the
substance of what I verbally said the other day in your presence,
to Governor Bramlette and Senator Dixon. It was
about as follows:</p>

<p>&#8220;I am naturally anti-slavery. If slavery is not wrong,
nothing is wrong. I can not remember when I did not so
think and feel. And yet, I have never understood that the
Presidency conferred upon me an unrestricted right to act
officially upon this judgment and feeling. It was in the oath
I took, that I would, to the best of my ability, preserve, protect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
and defend the Constitution of the United States. I
could not take the office without taking the oath. Nor was
it my view, that I might take an oath to get power, and
break the oath in using the power. I understood, too, that in
ordinary civil administration, this oath even forbade me to
practically indulge my primary, abstract judgment, on the
moral question of slavery. I had publicly declared this many
times, and in many ways. And I aver that, to this day, I
have done no official act in mere deference to my abstract
judgment and feeling on slavery.</p>

<p>&#8220;I did understand, however, that my oath to preserve the
Constitution to the best of my ability, imposed upon me the
duty of preserving, by every indispensable means, the Government&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;that
Nation&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;of which that Constitution was the
organic law. Was it possible to lose the Nation, and yet
preserve the Constitution?</p>

<p>&#8220;By general law, life and limb must be protected: yet often
a limb must be amputated to save a life; but a life is never
wisely given to save a limb. I feel that measures, otherwise
unconstitutional, might become lawful, by becoming indispensable
to the preservation of the Constitution, through the
preservation of the Nation. Right or wrong, I assumed this
ground and now avow it. I could not feel that to the best
of my ability I had even tried to preserve the Constitution, if
to save slavery or any minor matter, I should permit the
wreck of Government, Country and Constitution, all together.
When early in the war, Gen. Fremont attempted military
emancipation, I forbade it, because I did not then think it an
indispensable necessity. When a little later, Gen. Cameron,
then Secretary of War, suggested the arming of the blacks, I
objected, because I did not yet think it an indispensable
necessity. When, still later, Gen. Hunter attempted military
emancipation, I again forbade it, because I did not yet think
the indispensable necessity had come.</p>

<p>&#8220;When, in March, and May, and July, 1862, I made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
earnest and successive appeals to the Border States to favor
compensated emancipation, I believed the indispensable
necessity for military emancipation and arming the blacks
would come, unless averted by that measure. They declined
the proposition, and I was, in my best judgment, driven to
the alternative of either surrendering the Union, and with it
the Constitution, or of laying strong hand upon the colored
element. I chose the latter. In choosing it, I hoped for
greater gain than loss; but of this I was not entirely confident.
More than a year of trial now shows no loss by it, in
our foreign relations; none in our home popular sentiment;
none in our white military force&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;no loss by it anyhow or
anywhere. On the contrary, it shows a gain of quite a
hundred and thirty thousand soldiers, seamen, and laborers.
These are palpable facts, about which, as facts, there can be
no caviling. We have the men, and we could not have had
them without the measure.</p>

<p>&#8220;And now, let any Union man who complains of the
measure, test himself, by writing down in one line that he is
for subduing the rebellion by force of arms, and in the next
that he is for taking these one hundred and thirty thousand
men from the Union side, and placing them where they
would be, but for the measure he condemns. If he can not
face his cause so stated, it is only because he can not face the
truth.</p>

<p>&#8220;I add a word, which was not in the verbal conversation.
In telling this tale, I attempt no compliment to my own
sagacity. I claim not to have controlled events, but confess
plainly that events have controlled me. Now, at the end of
three years&#8217; struggle, the Nation&#8217;s condition is not what either
party or any man devised or expected. God alone can claim
it. Whither it is tending, seems plain. If God now wills
the removal of a great wrong, and wills also that we of the
North, as well as you of the South, shall pay fairly for
our complicity in that wrong, impartial history will find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
therein new cause to attest and revere the justice and goodness
of God.</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="l2">&#8220;Yours truly,</span><br />
&#8220;<span class="smcap">A. Lincoln</span>.&#8221;<br />

<p>The results of the employment of negro soldiers&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;a measure
which, at the time it was first announced, caused no little
commotion among the over-sensitive in the loyal States, and
was looked upon with disfavor by many white soldiers, as well&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;as
shown in the above letter, precluded further arguments
upon the question.</p>

<p>The Davis combination at Richmond, having announced
that none of the immunities recognized under the laws of war
would be granted to colored soldiers or their officers, General
Orders No. 100, under date of April 24, 1863, &#8220;previously
approved by the President,&#8221; promulgating general instructions
for the government of our armies, was issued, containing
the following:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;The law of nations knows of no distinction of color; and
if an enemy of the United States should enslave and sell any
captured persons of their army, it would be a case for the
severest retaliation, if not redressed upon complaint. The
United States cannot retaliate by enslavement; therefore,
death must be the retaliation for this crime against the law
of nations.</p>

<p>&#8220;All troops of the enemy known or discovered to give no
quarter in general, or to any portion of the army, will receive
none.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>The following order of the President, issued by him as
Commander-in-chief, and communicated to the entire army
deals with this subject alone:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sigright">
&#8220;<i>Executive Mansion</i>, Washington, July 30, 1863.<br />
</p>

<p>&#8220;It is the duty of every Government to give protection to
its citizens of whatever class, color or condition, and especially
to those who are duly organized as soldiers in the
public service. The law of nations, and the usages and customs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
of war, as carried on by civilized powers, prohibit no
distinction as to color in the treatment of prisoners of war as
public enemies. To sell or enslave any captured person, on
account of his color, and for no offence against the laws of
war, is a relapse into barbarism, and a crime against the civilization
of the age.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Government of the United States will give the same
protection to all its soldiers; and if the enemy shall sell or
enslave any one because of his color, the offence shall be punished
by retaliation upon the enemy&#8217;s prisoners in our possession.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is therefore ordered, that for every soldier of the United
States killed in violation of the laws of war, a rebel soldier
shall be executed; and for every one enslaved by the enemy
or sold into slavery, a rebel soldier shall be placed at hard
labor on the public works, and continued at such labor until
the one shall be released and receive the treatment due to a
prisoner of war.</p>

<p>In 1864, those grand military combinations were planned
and had their commencement which were to give the quietus
to that gigantic rebellion, which, as we had been gravely and
repeatedly assured by patronizing foreigners and ill-wishers
of the Republic here at home, could never be subdued&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;to
which, they being judges, the United States would eventually
be forced to succumb.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
On the 2nd of March, the President approved a bill, passed
by Congress on the 26th of February, reviving the grade of
Lieutenant-General in the Army, to which position he at
once nominated, and the Senate unanimously confirmed,
Ulysses S. Grant, then Major-General.</p>

<p>Like the President, Gen. Grant sprang from &#8220;plain
people;&#8221; arose from humble circumstances, and had none of
those advantages of birth, or family connections, or large
estate, which have so often furnished such material leverage for
men who have attained distinction. Entering the army as
Colonel of an Illinois regiment, on the point of being disbanded,
which within a month he had made noticeable for its discipline
and character, even when compared with those noteworthy
regiments which Illinois has furnished; promoted to the grade
of Brigadier-General; preventing, by the battle of Belmont&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;criticised
at the time, but, like many other engagements,
little understood&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;the reinforcement of the rebels in Southern
Missouri by troops from Columbus; seizing, with a strong
force, which he had quietly gathered near Smithland, almost
at one fell swoop, Forts Henry and Donelson&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;a rebel army,
with artillery, and material, being captured in each; starting
the till then defiant rebels on a run from Kentucky and Tennessee,
which did not end until they reached Corinth; next
fighting the battle of Shiloh, a critical point of the war, with
Sherman as Chief Lieutenant&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;Shiloh, of which he said, at the
close of the first day&#8217;s fight, when every thing seemed against
us, &#8220;Tough work to-day, but we&#8217;ll beat them to-morrow;&#8221;
superseded by Buell, patiently sitting at the long, unprofitable
siege of Corinth, until he was transferred to Vicksburg, which
in due time greeted him with the surrender of another rebel
army, reopening the Father of Waters to navigation; then
Chattanooga, which he ordered Thomas to hold fast, and not
to give up, if he starved&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;and it was not given up, and East
Tennessee was freed from rebels; these had been the prominent
points of Grant&#8217;s military career during the rebellion up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
to the time when he was summoned to the command of all
the armies then engaged in its suppression.</p>

<p>On the 9th of March, being upon official business at Washington,
the General was invited to the White House, and addressed
as follows by the President, who handed him his
commission:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">General Grant</span>:&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;The expression of the nation&#8217;s approbation
of what you have already done, and its reliance on you
for what remains to do in the existing great struggle, is now
presented with this commission, constituting you Lieutenant-General
of the Army of the United States.</p>

<p>&#8220;With this high honor devolves on you an additional
responsibility. As the country herein trusts you, so, under
God, it will sustain you. I scarcely need add, that with
what I here speak for the country, goes my own hearty personal
concurrence.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Sherman having been left in command in the south-west,
with instructions to capture Atlanta, the vital point in
Georgia, commenced that grand series of flanking movements,
which, for a time, seemed to occasion intense satisfaction to
the rebels, whose commander, Johnston, upon all occasions
had Sherman exactly where he wished him; while Grant&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;taciturn,
cool, and collected, with no set speeches, no flourish
of reviews&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;proceeded with the difficult task which he had
taken in hand&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;the annihilation or capture of Lee&#8217;s army, the
mainstay of the rebels&#8217; military resources, and the occupation
of Richmond.</p>

<p>On the 30th of April, the President addressed the following
letter to the new Commander:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Lieutenant-General Grant</span>:&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;Not expecting to see you
before the spring campaign opens, I wish to express in this
way my entire satisfaction with what you have done up to
this time, so far as I understand it. The particulars of your
plan I neither know, nor seek to know. You are vigilant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
and self-reliant; and pleased with this, I wish not to obtrude
any restraints or constraints upon you. While I am very
anxious that any great disaster or capture of our men in
great numbers shall be avoided, I know that these points are
less likely to escape your attention than they would be mine.</p>

<p>&#8220;If there be any thing wanting which is in my power to
give, do not fail to let me know it. And now, with a brave
army and a just cause, may God sustain you!</p>

<p>
&#8220;Yours, very truly,      <span class="right"><span class="smcap">A. Lincoln</span>.&#8221;</span><br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>To which the General, from Culpepper Court House, Va.,
on the 1st of May, thus replied:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">To The President</span>:&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;Your very kind letter is just received.
The confidence you express for the future and satisfaction
for the past, in my military administration, is acknowledged
with pride. It shall be my earnest endeavor that you
and the country shall not be disappointed.</p>

<p>&#8220;From my first entrance into the volunteer service of the
country to the present day, I have never had cause of complaint,
have never expressed or implied a complaint against
the Administration, or the Secretary of War, for throwing
any embarrassment in the way of my vigorously prosecuting
what appeared to be my duty.</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed, since the promotion which placed me in command
of all the armies, and in view of the great responsibility and
importance of success, I have been astonished at the readiness
with which every thing asked for has been yielded, without
even an explanation being asked. Should my success be less
than I desire and expect, the least I can say is, the fault is
not with you.</p>

<p class="b0">&#8220;Very truly, your obedient servant,</p>

<p class="p0 sigright">
&#8220;<span class="smcap">U.&nbsp;S. Grant</span>, Lieutenant-General.&#8221;<br />

<p>Beginning at the right end&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;profiting by the experience of
others&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;wasting no time nor strength in mere display&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>promptly
breaking up, as an essential preliminary, the cliques
and cabals which had so long hindered the usefulness of the
Army of the Potomac&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;when the Lieutenant-General was at
last ready, he moved across the Rapidan, was attacked impetuously
by Lee with his whole army before he had fairly
posted his own&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;&#8220;Any other man,&#8221; said Mr. Lincoln, &#8220;would
have been on this side of the Rapidan after the first three
days&#8217; fighting&#8221;&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;still fought&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;moved by the left flank&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;fought
on&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;prepared, after six days very heavy work, as he telegraphed
the President, &#8220;to fight it out on that line, if it
took all summer&#8221;&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;outgeneralled Lee at Spottsylvania Court
House&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;secured his position&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;and held it till the contemplated
movements in other quarters should place the prize he aimed
at within his grasp.</p>

<p>Holding his ground, undeterred by an attempted diversion,
in July, in the shape of a rebel raid toward Washington and
an invasion of Maryland&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;a favorite summer pastime, in
those days, for the Confederates&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;he bided his time, his teeth
fixed, and the utmost efforts of his wily opponent could not
induce him to relax that grim hold. Richmond papers
sneered and scolded and abused&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;proved that he ought to
have acted entirely otherwise&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;asseverated that he was no
strategist, but simply a lucky blunderer, a butcher on a vast
scale; and rebel sympathizers in the North served up, in
talk and print, approved re-hashes of the same staple, and
were in the highest dudgeon that General McClellan was not
recalled instanter to save the Capital at least, if not to take
Richmond. But Grant still held on&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;the teeth still set&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;and
could not be moved.</p>

<p>While this campaign was progressing, the President addressed
the following letter to the Committee of Arrangements
of a mass meeting in New York, which had been called as a
testimonial of confidence in General Grant, and of satisfaction
that his efforts had been crowned with so large a measure
of success:</p>

mass meeting of the loyal citizens to be held at New York

to Lieutenant-General Grant for his signal services, was
received yesterday. It is impossible for me to attend. I
approve, nevertheless, whatever may tend to strengthen and
sustain General Grant and the noble armies now under his
direction. My previous high estimate of General Grant has
been maintained and heightened by what has occurred in the
remarkable campaign he is now conducting; while the magnitude
and difficulty of the task before him do not prove less
than I expected. He and his brave soldiers are now in the
midst of their great trial, and I trust that at your meeting
you will so shape your good words that they may turn to
men and guns moving to his and their support.</p>

</p></blockquote>

<p>On the 7th of June, the Republican National Convention
met at Baltimore for the purpose of nominating candidates for
the Presidency and Vice-Presidency.</p>

<p>For some time prior to the assembling of this body, the
popular voice had pronounced decidedly in favor of the renomination
of Mr. Lincoln. State Legislatures, mass meetings,
State Conventions, the large majority of the loyal press
demanded that the man, to whose election, constitutionally
effected, the rebels had refused to submit and who, during
three years of the most arduous labors, had evinced his
patriotism, his ability, and his integrity, should have the satisfaction
of seeing the work commenced by himself as President
brought to a successful completion while an incumbent of the
same high office.</p>

<p>A few, however, in the ranks of the loyal and patriotic,
were not satisfied that the good work, whose consummation
they so ardently and perhaps, impatiently, desired, had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
pushed forward as vigorously and earnestly as it might have
been under other auspices. A portion of these favored the
postponement of the Convention till a later day, after the
fourth of July ensuing, in the expectation that the country
would be in a better condition to judge whether, indeed,
Mr. Lincoln was the best man for the place. Another
portion had already assembled at Chicago and put in nomination,
upon a platform devoted mainly to criticisms of Mr.
Lincoln&#8217;s Administration without any practical or pertinent
suggestion as to the points wherein improvement was to be
made, General Fremont for the Presidency and General
Cochrane as Vice-President. The former had therefore resigned
his commission in the army, not having been in active
service for some time, and accepted the nomination conditionally
that the Baltimore Convention nominated no
other candidate than Mr. Lincoln.</p>

<p>This opposition, however, was more apparent than real.
The general feeling throughout the country was to support
that man heartily who should secure the nomination of the
Republican Convention, waiving all minor questions for the
sake of the common weal.</p>

<p>On the second day, the convention adopted by acclamation
the following platform:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<i>Resolved</i>, That it is the highest duty of every American
citizen to maintain against all their enemies the integrity of
the Union and the paramount authority of the Constitution
and laws of the United States; and that, laying aside all
differences of political opinion, we pledge ourselves as Union
men, animated by a common sentiment, and aiming at a
common object, to do every thing in our power to aid the
Government in quelling by force of arms the rebellion now
raging against its authority, and in bringing to the punishment
due to their crimes, the rebels and traitors arrayed
against it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
&#8220;<i>Resolved</i>, That we approve the determination of the Government
of the United States not to compromise with rebels,
nor to offer any terms of peace except such as may be based
upon an &#8216;unconditional surrender&#8217; of their hostility and a
return to their just allegiance to the Constitution and laws of
the United States, and that we call upon the Government to
maintain this position and to prosecute the war with the
utmost possible vigor to the complete suppression of the
rebellion, in full reliance upon the self-sacrifice, the patriotism,
the heroic valor, and the undying devotion of the American
people to their country and its free institutions.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Resolved</i>, That, as Slavery was the cause, and now constitutes
the strength, of this rebellion, and as it must be
always and everywhere hostile to the principles of republican
government, justice and the national safety demand its utter
and complete extirpation from the soil of the Republic; and
that we uphold and maintain the acts and proclamations by
which the Government, in its own defence, has aimed a
death-blow at this gigantic evil. We are in favor, furthermore,
of such an amendment to the Constitution, to be made
by the people in conformity with its provisions, as shall
terminate and forever prohibit the existence of Slavery within
the limits of the jurisdiction of the United States.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Resolved</i>, That the thanks of the American people are due
to the soldiers and sailors of the army and of the navy, who
have perilled their lives in defence of their country, and in
vindication of the honor of the flag; that the Nation owes to
them some permanent recognition of their patriotism and their
valor, and ample and permanent provision for those of their
survivors who have received disabling and honorable wounds
in the service of the country; and that the memories of those
who have fallen in its defence shall be held in grateful and
everlasting remembrance.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Resolved</i>, That we approve and applaud the practical
wisdom, the unselfish patriotism, and unswerving fidelity to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
the Constitution and the principles of American liberty, with
which Abraham Lincoln has discharged, under circumstances
of unparalleled difficulty, the great duties and responsibilities
of the presidential office; that we approve and indorse, as
demanded by the emergency, and essential to the preservation
of the Nation, and as within the Constitution, the measures
and acts which he has adopted to defend the Nation against
its open and secret foes; that we approve especially the
Proclamation of Emancipation, and the employment as Union
soldiers of men heretofore held in Slavery; and that we have
full confidence in his determination to carry these and all
other constitutional measures essential to the salvation of the
country into full and complete effect.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Resolved</i>, That we deem it essential to the general welfare
that harmony should prevail in the National councils, and we
regard as worthy of public confidence and official trust those
only who cordially indorse the principles contained in those
resolutions, and which should characterize the administration
of the Government.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Resolved</i>, That the Government owes to all men employed
in its armies, without regard to distinction of color, the full
protection of the laws of war; and that any violation of these
laws or of the usages of civilized nations in the time of war by
the Rebels now in arms, should be made the subject of full
and prompt redress.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Resolved</i>, That the foreign immigration, which in the past
has added so much to the wealth and development of resources
and increase of power to this Nation, the asylum of
the oppressed of all nations, should be fostered and encouraged
by a liberal and just policy.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Resolved</i>, That we are in favor of the speedy construction
of the railroad to the Pacific.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Resolved</i>, That the national faith pledged for the redemption
of the public debt must be kept inviolate, and that for
this purpose we recommend economy and rigid responsibility<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
in the public expenditures, and a vigorous and just system
of taxation; that it is the duty of every loyal State to sustain
the credit and promote the use of the national currency.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Resolved</i>, That we approve the position taken by the
Government that the people of the United States can never
regard with indifference the attempt of any European power
to overthrow by force, or to supplant by fraud the institutions
of any republican government on the Western Continent;
and that they will view with extreme jealousy, as
menacing to the peace and independence of this our country
the efforts of any such power to obtain new footholds for
monarchical governments, sustained by a foreign military
force in near proximity to the United States.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Upon the first ballot for a candidate for President, <span class="smcap">Abraham
Lincoln</span> received the vote of every State, except Missouri,
whose delegates voted for Gen. Grant. The nomination
having, on motion of a Missourian, been made unanimous,
a scene of the wildest enthusiasm followed, the whole convention
being on their feet shouting, and the band playing &#8220;Hail
Columbia.&#8221;</p>

<p>For Vice-President, the following names were presented:
Andrew Johnson, of Tennessee; Hannibal Hamlin, of Maine;
Gen. L.&nbsp;H. Rousseau, of Kentucky; and Daniel S. Dickinson,
of New York.</p>

<p>As the vote proceeded, it was soon apparent that <span class="smcap">Andrew
Johnson</span> was to be the nominee; and before the result was
announced the various States whose delegations had been
divided, commenced changing their votes, and went unanimously
for Mr. Johnson, amid the greatest enthusiasm.</p>

<p>On the 9th of June, Mr. Lincoln was waited on by a committee
of the convention, and notified of his nomination by
the chairman, ex-Governor Dennison, of Ohio, who, in the
course of his address, said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span></p><blockquote>

<p>&#8220;I need not say to you, sir, that the Convention, in thus
unanimously nominating you for re-election, but gave utterance
to the almost universal voice of the loyal people of the
country. To doubt of your triumphant election would be
little short of abandoning the hope of a final suppression of
the rebellion and the restoration of the Government over the
insurgent States. Neither the Convention nor those represented
by that body entertained any doubt as to the final result,
under your administration, sustained by the loyal people,
and by our noble army and gallant navy. Neither did the
Convention, nor do this Committee doubt the speedy suppression
of this most wicked and unprovoked rebellion.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>In reply the President said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen of the Committee</span>:&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;I
will neither conceal my gratification nor restrain the expression
of my gratitude that the Union people, through their
Convention, in the continued effort to save and advance the
nation, have deemed me not unworthy to remain in my
present position. I know no reason to doubt that I shall
accept the nomination tendered; and yet, perhaps, I should
not declare definitely before reading and considering what is
called the platform.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will say now, however, that I approve the declaration
in favor of so amending the Constitution as to prohibit slavery
throughout the nation. When the people in revolt, with the
hundred days explicit notice that they could within those
days resume their allegiance without the overthrow of their
institutions, and that they could not resume it afterward,
elected to stand out, such an amendment of the Constitution
as is now proposed became a fitting and necessary conclusion
to the final success of the Union cause.</p>

<p>&#8220;Such alone can meet and cover all cavils. I now perceive
its importance, and embrace it. In the joint name of
Liberty and Union let us labor to give it legal form and practical
effect.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
On the following day, in reply to a congratulatory address
from a deputation of the National Union League, the President
said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>:&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;I can only say in response to the remarks
of your Chairman, I suppose, that I am very grateful for the
renewed confidence which has been accorded to me, both by
the Convention and by the National League. I am not insensible
at all to the personal compliment there is in this;
yet I do not allow myself to believe that any but a small portion
of it is to be appropriated as a personal compliment
to me.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Convention and the Nation, I am assured, are alike
animated by a higher view of the interests of the country for
the present and the great future, and that part I am entitled
to appropriate as a compliment is only that which I may lay
hold of, as being the opinion of the Convention and the
League, that I am not entirely unworthy to be entrusted with
the place I have occupied for the last three years.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have not permitted myself, gentlemen, to conclude that
I am the best man in the country; but I am reminded in this
connection, of the story of an old Dutch farmer, who remarked
to a companion once, that &#8216;it was not best to swop horses
when crossing streams.&#8217;&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Prolonged and tumultuous laughter followed this last characteristic
remark, given with that telling force which only
those who had the privilege of meeting Mr. Lincoln in his
moments of relaxation and semi-<i>abandon</i> can appreciate.</p>

<p>Having been serenaded, on the 9th, by the delegation from
Ohio, he addressed the assemblage as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>:&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;I am very much obliged to you for this
compliment. I have just been saying, and will repeat it,
that the hardest of all speeches I have to answer is a serenade.
I never knew what to say on such occasions.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose you have done me this kindness in connection
with the action of the Baltimore Convention, which has recently
taken place, and with which, of course, I am very well
satisfied. What we want still more than Baltimore Conventions
or Presidential elections, is success under General
Grant.</p>

<p>&#8220;I propose that you constantly bear in mind that the support
you owe to the brave officers and soldiers in the field is
of the very first importance, and we should therefore lend all
our energies to that point.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, without detaining you any longer, I propose that
you help me to close up what I am now saying with three
rousing cheers for General Grant and the officers and
soldiers under his command.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>And the cheers were given with a will, the President
leading off and waving his hat with as much earnestness as
the most enthusiastic individual present.</p>

<p>To a regiment of Ohio troops, one hundred days men, volunteers
for the emergency then upon the country, who called,
on the 11th, upon Mr. Lincoln, he spoke as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Soldiers</span>:&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;I understand you have just come from Ohio&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;come
to help us in this the nation&#8217;s day of trial, and also
of its hopes. I thank you for your promptness in responding
to the call for troops. Your services were never needed
more than now. I know not where you are going. You
may stay here and take the places of those who will be sent
to the front; or you may go there yourselves. Wherever
you go, I know you will do your best. Again I thank you.
Good-bye.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p class="hang">President&#8217;s Speech at Philadelphia&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;Philadelphia Fair&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;Correspondence with Committee
of National Convention&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;Proclamation of Martial Law in Kentucky&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;Question of Reconstruction&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;President&#8217;s
Proclamation on the subject&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;Congressional Plan.</p></blockquote>

<p>On the 16th of June, the President was present at a Fair
held in Philadelphia in aid of that noble organization,
the United States Sanitary Commission, which was productive
of so much good during the war, placing as it did, the
arrangements for the care and comfort of our brave boys on
a basis which no nation&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;not France, not England, though
experienced in war, and generally of admirable promptitude
in availing themselves of all facilities to its successful prosecution&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;had
ever before been able to secure.</p>

<p>On the occasion of this visit, Philadelphia witnessed
one of her largest crowds. Not less than fifteen thousand
people were straining to get a glimpse of their beloved
President at one and the same moment.</p>

<p>After the customary hand-shaking, borne by the victim
with contagious good humor, a collation was served, at
the close of which, in acknowledgment of a toast to his
health, drank with the heartiest sincerity by all present, the
President said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;I suppose that this toast is intended to open the way for
me to say something. War at the best is terrible; and
this of ours in its magnitude and duration is one of the most
terrible the world has ever known. It has deranged business
totally in many places, and perhaps in all.</p>

<p>&#8220;It has destroyed property, destroyed life, and ruined
homes. It has produced a national debt and a degree of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
taxation unprecedented in the history of this country. It has
caused mourning among us until the heavens may almost be
said to be hung in black. And yet it continues. It has had
accompaniments not before known in the history of the
world.</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean the Sanitary and Christian Commissions, with
their labors for the relief of the soldiers, and the Volunteer
Refreshment Saloon, understood better by those who hear me
than by myself. These Fairs, too, first began at Chicago,
then held in Boston, Cincinnati, and other cities.</p>

<p>&#8220;The motive and object which lies at the bottom of them
is worthy of the most that we can do for the soldier who
goes to fight the battles of his country. By the fair and
tender hand of woman is much, very much, done for the
soldier, continually reminding him of the care and thought of
him at home. The knowledge that he is not forgotten is
grateful to his heart.</p>

<p>&#8220;And the view of these institutions is worthy of thought.
They are voluntary contributions, giving proof that the
national resources are not at all exhausted, and that the
national patriotism will sustain us through all. It is a pertinent
question&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;when is this war to end?</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not wish to name a day when it will end, lest
the end should not come at the given time. We accepted
this war, and did not begin it. We accepted it for an object;
and when that object is accomplished, the war will end;
and I hope to God it will never end until that object
is accomplished.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are going through with our task, so far as I am
concerned, if it takes us three years longer. I have not been
in the habit of making predictions, but I am almost tempted
now to hazard one. I will. It is that Grant is this evening
in a position, with Meade and Hancock of Pennsylvania,
where he can never be dislodged by the enemy until Richmond
is taken.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>
&#8220;If I shall discover that General Grant may be facilitated
in the capture of Richmond by rapidly pouring to him
a large number of armed men at the briefest notice, will you
go? [Cries of &#8216;Yes.&#8217;] Will you march on with him?
[Cries of &#8216;Yes, yes.&#8217;]</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I shall call upon you when it is necessary.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>The following correspondence passed between Mr. Lincoln
and the Committee of the National Convention relative to his
nomination:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sigright">

&#8220;New York, June 14, 1864.</p>

<p class="in0">&#8220;<span class="smcap">Hon. Abraham Lincoln</span>:
</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Sir</span>:&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;The National Union Convention, which assembled
in Baltimore on June 7, 1864, has instructed us to inform you
that you were nominated with enthusiastic unanimity, for the
Presidency of the United States for four years from the
4th of March next.</p>

<p>&#8220;The resolutions of the Convention, which we have
already had the honor of placing in your hands, are a
full and clear statement of the principles which inspired its
action, and which, as we believe, the great body of Union men
in the country heartily approve. Whether those resolutions
express the national gratitude to our soldiers and sailors, or
the national scorn of compromise with rebels, and consequent
dishonor; or the patriotic duty of Union and success; whether
they approve the Proclamation of Emancipation, the Constitutional
amendment, the employment of former slaves as
Union soldiers, or the solemn obligation of the Government
promptly to redress the wrongs of every soldier of the
Union, of whatever color or race; whether they declare the
inviolability of the pledged faith of the nation, or offer
the national hospitality to the oppressed of every land,
or urge the union, by railroad, of the Atlantic and Pacific
oceans; whether they recommend public economy and a
vigorous taxation, or assert the fixed popular opposition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>
to the establishment of avowed force of foreign monarchies
in the immediate neighborhood of the United States, or
declare that those only are worthy of official trust who
approve unreservedly the views and policy indicated in
the resolutions&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;they were equally hailed with the heartiness
of profound conviction.</p>

<p>&#8220;Believing with you, sir, that this is the people&#8217;s war for
the maintenance of a government which you have justly described
as &#8216;of the people, by the people, for the people,&#8217; we
are very sure that you will be glad to know, not only from
the resolutions themselves, but from the singular harmony
and enthusiasm with which they were adopted, how warm
is the popular welcome of every measure in the prosecution
of the war, which is as vigorous, unmistakable, and unfaltering
as the National purpose itself. No right, for instance, is
so precious and sacred to the American heart as that of personal
liberty. Its violation is regarded with just, instant, and
universal jealousy. Yet in this hour of peril every faithful
citizen concedes that, for the sake of National existence and
the common welfare, individual liberty may, as the Constitution
provides in case of rebellion, be sometimes summarily
constrained, asking only with painful anxiety that in every
instance, and to the least detail, that absolutely necessary
power shall not be hastily or unwisely exercised.</p>

<p>&#8220;We believe, sir, that the honest will of the Union men of
the country was never more truly represented than in this
Convention. Their purpose we believe to be the overthrow
of armed rebels in the field, and the security of permanent
peace and Union by liberty and justice under the Constitution.
That these results are to be achieved amid cruel perplexities,
they are fully aware. That they are to be reached
only by cordial unanimity of counsel, is undeniable. That
good men may sometimes differ as to the means and the time,
they know. That in the conduct of all human affairs the highest
duty is to determine, in the angry conflict of passion, how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
much good may be practically accomplished, is their sincere persuasion.
They have watched your official course, therefore,
with unflagging attention; and amid the bitter taunts of eager
friends and the fierce denunciations of enemies, now moving
too fast for some, now too slowly for others, they have seen
you throughout this tremendous contest patient, sagacious,
faithful, just, leaning upon the heart of the great mass of the
people, and satisfied to be moved by its mighty pulsation.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is for this reason that, long before the Convention met,
the popular instincts had plainly indicated you as its candidate;
and the Convention, therefore, merely recorded the
popular will. Your character and career proves your unswerving
fidelity to the cardinal principles of American
Liberty and of the American Constitution. In the name of
that Liberty and Constitution, sir, we earnestly request your
acceptance of this nomination; reverently commending our
beloved country, and you, its Chief Magistrate, with all its
brave sons who, on sea and land, are faithfully defending the
good old American cause of equal rights, to the blessings of
Almighty God, we are, sir, very respectfully, your friends
and fellow-citizens.</p>

<p>On the 5th of July, appeared the following proclamation,
ordering martial law in Kentucky:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Whereas</span>, By a proclamation, which was issued on the
15th day of April, 1861, the President of the United States
announced and declared that the laws of the United States
had been for some time past, and then were, opposed and the
execution thereof obstructed, in certain States therein mentioned,
by combinations too powerful to be suppressed by the
ordinary course of judicial proceedings, or by the power
vested in the marshals by law; and,</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Whereas</span>, Immediately after the issuing of the said proclamation,
the land and naval force of the United States were
put into activity to suppress the said insurrection and rebellion;
and,</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Whereas</span>, The Congress of the United States, by an act
approved on the 3d day of March, 1863, did enact that during
the said rebellion the President of the United States, whenever
in his judgment the public safety may require it, is
authorized to suspend the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>
in any case throughout the United States, or any part
thereof; and,</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Whereas</span>, The said insurrection and rebellion still continues,
endangering the existence of the Constitution and
Government of the United States; and,</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Whereas</span>, The military forces of the United States are
now actively engaged in suppressing the said insurrection and
rebellion in various parts of the States where the said rebellion
has been successful in obstructing the laws and public
authorities, especially in the States of Virginia and Georgia;
and,</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Whereas</span>, On the 15th day of September last, the President
of the United States duly issued his proclamation,
wherein he declared that the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas
corpus</i> should be suspended throughout the United States, in
cases where, by the authority of the President of the United
States, the military, naval, and civil officers of the United
States, or any of them, hold persons under their command or
in their custody either as prisoners of war, spies, or aiders or
abettors of the enemy, or officers, soldiers, or seamen, enrolled,
or drafted, or mustered, or enlisted in, or belonging to, the
land or naval forces of the United States, or as deserters
therefrom, or otherwise amenable to military law or the rules
and articles of war, or the rules and regulations prescribed
for the military or naval service by authority of the President
of the United States, or for resisting a draft, or for any other
offence against the military or naval service; and,</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Whereas</span>, Many citizens of the State of Kentucky have
joined the forces of the insurgents, have on several occasions
entered the said State of Kentucky in large force, and not
without aid and comfort furnished by disaffected and disloyal
citizens of the United States residing therein, have not only
greatly disturbed the public peace, but have overborne the
civil authorities and made flagrant civil war, destroying
property and life in various parts of the State; and,</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Whereas</span>, It has been made known to the President of the
United States by the officers commanding the National
armies, that combinations have been formed in the said State
of Kentucky, with a purpose of inciting the rebel forces to
renew the said operations of civil war within the said State,
and thereby to embarrass the United States armies now operating
in the said States of Virginia and Georgia, and even to
endanger their safety;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, therefore, I, <span class="smcap">Abraham Lincoln</span>, President of the
United States, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the
Constitution and laws, do hereby declare, that in my judgment
the public safety especially requires that the suspension
of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>, so proclaimed
in the said proclamation of the fifteenth of September, 1863,
be made effectual, and be duly enforced in and throughout the
said State of Kentucky, and that martial law be for the present
ordered therein. I do therefore hereby require of the
military officers in the said State that the privilege of the
writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> be effectually suspended within the said
State, according to the aforesaid proclamation, and that martial
law be established therein, to take effect from the date of
this proclamation, the said suspension and establishment of
martial law to continue until this proclamation shall be revoked
or modified, but not beyond the period when the said
rebellion shall have been suppressed or come to an end. And
I do hereby require and command as well military officers as
all civil officers and authorities existing or found within the
said State of Kentucky, to take notice of this proclamation
and to give full effect to the same. The martial law herein
proclaimed, and the things in that respect herein ordered,
will not be deemed or taken to interfere with the holding of
elections, or with the proceedings of the Constitutional Legislature
of Kentucky, or with the administration of justice in
the courts of law existing therein between citizens of the
United States in suits or proceedings which do not affect the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>
military operations or the constituted authorities of the Government
of the United States.</p>

<p>&#8220;In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and
caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.</p>

<p>The question as to what principles should be adopted in
reconstructing the rebel States, as fast as the insurrection
within their limits should be suppressed, had already, as remarked
upon a former page, presented itself as one to be met
and disposed of. Congress having, at almost the last moment
of its session, passed a bill intended to meet this case, the
President issued the following proclamation, on the 9th of
July, practically approving the same and accepting its spirit,
but making exception in the case of Louisiana and Arkansas,
which States had been reorganized according to the spirit and
intent of a previous proclamation, making the will of one-tenth
of the voters of a State sufficient for its return to allegiance&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;the
bill under notice requiring the votes of a majority:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Whereas</span>, At the last session, Congress passed a bill to
guarantee to certain States whose Governments have been
usurped or overthrown, a republican form of government, a
copy of which is hereunto annexed; and,</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Whereas</span>, The said bill was presented to the President
of the United States for his approval, less than one hour
before the <i>sine die</i> adjournment of said session, and was not
signed by him; and,</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Whereas</span>, The said bill contains, among other things, a
plan for restoring the States in rebellion to the proper practical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>
relation in the Union, which plan presents the sense of
Congress upon that subject, and which plan it is now thought
fit to lay before the people for their consideration:</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, therefore, I, <span class="smcap">Abraham Lincoln</span>, President of the
United States, do proclaim, declare, and make known, that,
while I am, as I was in December last, when by proclamation
I propounded a plan for restoration, unprepared, by a
formal approval of this bill, to be inflexibly committed to any
single plan of restoration, and while I am also unprepared
to declare that the Free State Constitutions and Governments
already adopted and installed in Arkansas and Louisiana shall
be set aside and held for naught, thereby repelling and discouraging
the loyal citizens who have set up the same, as to
further effort, or to declare a constitutional competency in
Congress to establish slavery in States, but am at the same
time sincerely hoping and expecting that a constitutional
amendment abolishing slavery throughout the nation may be
adopted; nevertheless I am fully satisfied with the system of
restoration contained in the bill as one very proper plan for
the loyal people of any State choosing to adopt it, and that
I am and at all times shall be prepared to give the Executive
aid and assistance to any such people, so soon as the military
resistance to the United States shall have been suppressed in
any such State, and the people thereof shall have sufficiently
returned to their obedience to the Constitution and the laws
of the United States, in which cases military Governors will
be appointed, with directions to proceed according to the bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;In testimony whereof, I have hereunto set my hand,
and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives
of the United States of America, in Congress assembled</i>, That
in the States declared in rebellion against the United States,
the President shall, by and with the advice and consent of
the Senate, appoint for each a Provisional Governor, whose
pay and emoluments shall not exceed those of a Brigadier-General
of Volunteers, who shall be charged with the
civil administration of such State, until a State Government
therein shall be recognized as hereinafter provided.</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Section 2.</span> <i>And be it further enacted</i>, That so soon
as the military resistance to the United States shall have been
suppressed in any such State, and the people thereof shall
have sufficiently returned to their obedience to the Constitution
and laws of the United States, the Provisional Governor
shall direct the Marshal of the United States, as speedily as
may be, to name a sufficient number of deputies, and to
enroll all white male citizens of the United States, resident
in the State, in their respective counties, and to require each
one to take the oath to support the Constitution of the United
States, and in his enrollment to designate those who take and
those who refuse to take that oath, which rolls shall be forthwith
returned to the Provisional Governor; and if the
persons taking that oath shall amount to a majority of
the persons enrolled in the State, he shall, by proclamation,
invite the loyal people of the State to elect delegates to a
Convention, charged to declare the will of the people of the
State, relative to the reëstablishment of a State Government
subject to, and in conformity with the Constitution of the
United States.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span>
&#8220;<span class="smcap">Section 3.</span> That the Convention shall consist of as many
members as both Houses of the last Constitutional State
Legislature, apportioned by the Provisional Governor among
the counties, parishes, or districts of the State, in proportion
to the white population returned as electors by the Marshal,
in compliance with the provisions of this Act. The Provisional
Governor shall, by proclamation, declare the number
of delegates to be elected by each county, parish, or election
district; name a day of election not less than thirty days
thereafter; designate the place of voting in each county,
parish, or election district, conforming as nearly as may
be convenient, to the places used in the State elections
next preceding the rebellion; appoint one or more Commissioners
to hold the election at each place of voting, and provide
an adequate force to keep the peace during the election.</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Section 4.</span> That the delegates shall be elected by the
loyal white male citizens of the United States, of the age of
twenty-one years, and resident at the time in the county,
parish, or election district in which they shall offer to
vote, and enrolled as aforesaid, or absent in the military
service of the United States, and who shall take and subscribe
the oath of allegiance to the United States in the form contained
in the Act of Congress of July 2, 1862; and all such
citizens of the United States who are in the military service
of the United States, shall vote at the head-quarters of their
respective commands, under such regulations as may be prescribed
by the Provisional Governor for the taking and return
of their votes; but no person who has held or exercised any
office, civil or military, State or Confederate, under the rebel
usurpation, or who has voluntarily borne arms against the
United States, shall vote or be eligible to be elected as delegate
at such election.</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Section 5.</span> That the said Commissioners, or either of
them, shall hold the election in conformity with this Act, and
so far as may be consistent therewith, shall proceed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>
the manner used in the State prior to the rebellion. The
oath of allegiance shall be taken and subscribed on the poll-book
in the form above described, but every person known by
or proved to the Commissioners to have held or exercised any
office, civil or military, State or Confederate, under the rebel
usurpation, or to have voluntarily borne arms against the
United States, shall be excluded, though he offer to take the
oath; and in case any person who shall have borne arms
against the United States shall offer to vote, he shall be
deemed to have borne arms voluntarily, unless he shall prove
the contrary by the testimony of a qualified voter. The poll-book,
showing the name and oath of each voter, shall
be returned to the Provisional Governor by the Commissioner
of elections, or the one acting, and the Provisional
Governor shall canvass such return, and declare the person
having the highest number of votes elected.</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Section 6.</span> That the Provisional Governor shall, by
proclamation, convene the delegates elected as aforesaid, at
the Capital of the State, on a day not more than three months
after the election, fixing at least thirty days&#8217; notice of such
day. In case the said Capital shall in his judgment be unfit,
he shall in his proclamation appoint another place. He shall
preside over the deliberations of the Convention, and administer
to each delegate, before taking his seat in the
Convention, the oath of allegiance to the United States in
the form above prescribed.</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Section 7.</span> That the Convention shall declare, on behalf
of the people of the State, their submission to the Constitution
and laws of the United States, and shall adopt the
following provisions, hereby prescribed by the United States
in the execution of the Constitutional duty to guarantee a
republican form of government to every State, and incorporate
them in the Constitution of the State; that is to say:</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>First.</i> No person who has held or exercised any office,
civil or military, except offices merely ministerial, and military<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span>
offices below the grade of Colonel, State or corporate,
under the usurping power, shall vote for, or be a member of
the Legislature, or Governor.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Second.</i> Involuntary servitude is forever prohibited,
and the freedom of all persons is guaranteed in said State.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Third.</i> No debt, State or corporate, created by or under
the sanction of the usurping power, shall be recognized or
paid by the State.</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Section 8.</span> That when the Convention shall have adopted
these provisions, it shall proceed to reëstablish a republican
form of Government, and ordain a Constitution containing
these provisions, which, when adopted, the Convention shall,
by ordinance, provide for submitting to the people of the
State entitled to vote under this law, at an election to be held
in the manner prescribed by the Act for the election of delegates,
but at a time and place named by the Convention, at
which Election the said Electors, and none others, shall vote
directly for or against such Constitution and form of State
government; and the returns of said election shall be made
to the Provisional Governor, who shall canvass the same in
the presence of the electors, and if a majority of the votes
cast shall be for the Constitution and form of government, he
shall certify the same, with a copy thereof, to the President
of the United States, who, after obtaining the assent of Congress
shall, by proclamation, recognize the government so
established, and none other, as the Constitutional Government
of the State, and from the date of such recognition, and
not before, Senators, and Representatives, and Electors for
President and Vice-President may be elected in such State,
according to the laws of the State and of the United States.</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Section 9.</span> That if the Convention shall refuse to reëstablish
the State Government on the conditions aforesaid,
the Provisional Governor shall declare it dissolved; but it
shall be the duty of the President, whenever he shall have
reason to believe that a sufficient number of the people of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span>State entitled to vote under this Act, in number not less than
a majority of those enrolled, as aforesaid, are willing to reëstablish
a State Government on the conditions aforesaid, to
direct the Provisional Governor to order another election of
delegates to a Convention for the purpose and in the manner
prescribed in this Act, and to proceed in all respects as hereinbefore
provided, either to dissolve the Convention, or to
certify the State Government reëstablished by it to the
President.</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Section 10.</span> That, until the United States shall have
recognized a republican form of State Government, the
Provisional Governor in each of said States shall see that
this Act, and the laws of the United States, and other laws
of the State in force when the State Government was overthrown
by the rebellion, are faithfully executed within the
State; but no law or usage whereby any person was heretofore
held in involuntary servitude shall be recognized or
enforced by any Court or officer in such State, and the laws
for the trial and punishment of white persons shall extend to
all persons, and jurors shall have the qualifications of voters
under this law for delegates to the Convention. The President
shall appoint such officers provided for by the laws of
the State when its government was overthrown as he may
find necessary to the civil administration of the State, all
which officers shall be entitled to receive the fees and emoluments
provided by the State laws for such officers.</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Section 11.</span> That, until the recognition of a State
Government, as aforesaid, the Provisional Governor shall,
under such regulations as he may prescribe, cause to be
assessed, levied, and collected, for the year eighteen hundred
and sixty-four, and every year thereafter, the taxes provided
by the laws of such State to be levied during the fiscal year
preceding the overthrow of the State Government thereof, in
the manner prescribed by the laws of the State, as nearly as
may be; and the officers appointed, as aforesaid, are vested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span>
with all powers of levying and collecting such taxes, by
distress or sale, as were vested in any officers or tribunal of
the State Government aforesaid for those purposes. The
proceeds of such taxes shall be accounted for to the Provisional
Governor, and be by him applied to the expenses of
the administration of the laws in such State, subject to the
direction of the President, and the surplus shall be deposited
in the Treasury of the United States, to the credit of such
State, to be paid to the State upon an appropriation therefor,
to be made when a republican form of government shall be
recognized therein by the United States.</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Section 12.</span> That all persons held to involuntary servitude
or labor in the States aforesaid, are hereby emancipated
and discharged therefrom, and they and their posterity shall

<p>On the 7th of July the following proclamation for a National
Fast appeared:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Whereas</span>, The Senate and House of Representatives, at
their last session, adopted a concurrent resolution which was
approved on the third day of July instant, and which was in
the words following:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;That the President of the United States is requested to
appoint a day of humiliation and prayer by the people of the
United States; that he request his constitutional advisers at
the head of the Executive Departments to unite with him, as
Chief Magistrate of the Nation, at the city of Washington,
and the members of Congress, and all magistrates, all civil,
military and naval officers, all soldiers, sailors, and marines,
with all loyal and law-abiding people, to convene at their
usual places of worship, or wherever they may be, to confess
and to repent of their manifold sins; to implore the compassion
and forgiveness of the Almighty, that, if consistent with
His will, the existing rebellion may be speedily suppressed,
and the supremacy of the Constitution and laws of the United
States may be established throughout all the States; to implore
Him, as the Supreme Ruler of all the world, not to
destroy us as a people, nor suffer us to be destroyed by the
hostility or connivance of other nations, or by obstinate adhesion
to our own counsels, which may be in conflict with His
eternal purposes, and to implore him to enlighten the mind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span>
of the Nation to know and to do his will, humbly believing
that it is not in accord ever with his will that our place should
be maintained as a wicked people among the family of nations;
to implore him to grant to our armed defenders and the
masses of the people that courage, power of resistance, and
endurance necessary to secure that result; to implore him in
his infinite goodness to soften the hearts, enlighten the minds,
and quicken the consciences of those in rebellion, that they
may lay down their arms and speedily return to their allegiance
to the United States, that they may not be utterly destroyed,
that the effusion of blood may be stayed, and that
unity and fraternity may be restored, and peace established
throughout all our borders.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the
United States, cordially concurring with the Congress of the
United States in the penitential and pious sentiments expressed
in the aforesaid resolution, and heartily approving of
the devotional design and purpose thereof, do hereby appoint
the first Thursday of August next, to be observed by the
people of the United States as a day of National humiliation
and prayer.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do hereby further invite and request the heads of the
Executive Department of this Government, together with all
legislators, all Judges and magistrates, and all other persons
exercising authority in the land, whether civil, military, or
naval, and all soldiers, seamen and marines in the National
service, and all other loyal and law-abiding people of the
United States, to assemble in their professed places of public
worship on that day, and there to render to the Almighty
and merciful Ruler of the universe such homage and such
confessions, and to offer him such supplications, as the Congress
of the United States have in their aforesaid resolution
so solemnly, so earnestly, and so reverently recommended.</p>

<p>&#8220;In testimony whereof, I have hereunto set my hand, and
caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span>
&#8220;Done at the City of Washington, this, the seventh day of
July, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred
and sixty-four, and of the Independence of the United States
the eighty-ninth.</p>

<p>
&#8220;By the President:      <span class="right"><span class="smcap">Abraham Lincoln</span></span><br />

&#8220;<span class="smcap">William H. Seward</span>, Secretary of State.&#8221;<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>To some Ohio volunteers, about to return home at the expiration
of their term of service, who had called upon the
President to pay him their respects, he spoke, on the 18th of
August, thus:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Soldiers</span>: You are about to return to your homes and
your friends, after having, as I learn, performed in camp a
comparatively short term of duty in this great contest. I am
greatly obliged to you and to all who have come forward at
the call of their country.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish it might be more generally and universally understood
what the country is now engaged in. We have, as all
will agree, a free Government, where every man has a right
to be equal with every other man. In this great struggle,
this form of government and every form of human rights is
endangered if our enemies succeed. There is more involved
in this contest than is realized by every one. There is involved
in this struggle the question whether your children
and my children shall enjoy the privileges we have enjoyed.
I say this, in order to impress upon you, if you are not
already so impressed, that no small matter should divert us
from our great purpose.</p>

<p>&#8220;There may be some inequalities in the practical working
of our system. It is fair that each man shall pay taxes in
exact proportion for the value of his property; but if we
should wait, before collecting a tax, to adjust the taxes upon
each man in exact proportion to every other man, we should
never collect any tax at all. There may be mistakes made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span>
somewhere; things may be done wrong, which the officers of
Government do all they can to prevent mistakes.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I beg of you, as citizens of this great Republic, not
to let your minds be carried off from the great work we have
before us. This struggle is too large for you to be diverted
from it by any small matter. When you return to your
homes, rise up to the height of a generation of men, worthy
of a free government, and we will carry out the great work
we have commenced. I return you my sincere thanks, soldiers,
for the honor you have done me this afternoon.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>And again, on the 22d of August, under similar circumstances:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Soldiers</span>:&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;I suppose you are going home to see your
families and friends. For the services you have done in this
great struggle in which we are engaged, I present you sincere
thanks for myself and the country.</p>

<p>&#8220;I almost always feel inclined, when I say any thing to soldiers,
to impress upon them, in a few brief remarks, the importance
of success in this contest. It is not merely for to-day,
but for all time to come, that we should perpetuate for our
children&#8217;s children that great and free Government which we
have enjoyed all our lives. I beg you to remember this, not
merely for my sake, but for yours. I happen temporarily to
occupy this big White House. I am a living witness that
any one of your children may look to come here as my father&#8217;s
child has.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is in order that each one of you may have, through
this free Government which we have enjoyed, an open field
and a fair chance for your industry, enterprise, and intelligence;
that you may all have equal privileges in the race of
life, with all its desirable human aspirations; it is for this that
the struggle should be maintained, that we may not lose our
birthrights&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;not only for one, but for two or three years.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>
The nation is worth fighting for, to secure such an unquestionable
jewel.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>During the excitement accompanying the rebel attempts
upon the National Capitol, during the month of July, heretofore
noticed, representations were made to the President that
certain individuals, professing to represent the rebel leaders,
were in Canada, anxious to enter into negotiations, with a
view to the restoration of peace.</p>

<p>In response to this suggestion, Mr. Lincoln issued the following
paper, which was very unsatisfactory to those who
affected to believe that peace could be secured upon any
basis short of the recognition of the Southern Confederacy
unless the rebels in arms were thoroughly defeated, dated,
Executive Mansion, Washington, July 18, 1864.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">To whom it may concern.</span>&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;Any proposition which embraces
the restoration of peace, the integrity of the Union,
and the abandonment of slavery, and which comes by and
with authority that can control the armies now at war against
the United States, will be received and considered by the
Executive Government of the United States, and will be met
by liberal terms on other substantial and collateral points, and
the bearers thereof shall have safe conduct both ways.</p>

<p class="sigright">
&#8220;<span class="smcap">Abraham Lincoln.</span>&#8221;<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>This ended that attempt to divide the supporters of the
Administration.</p>

<p>On the 29th of August, 1864, assembled at Chicago the
National Convention of the Democratic party. This had been
preceded by a &#8220;Mass Peace Convention,&#8221; at Syracuse, on the
18th of August, at which it had been resolved, among other
things, that it was the duty of the Chicago Convention to
give expression to a beneficent sentiment of peace and to
declare as the purpose of the Democratic party, if it should
recover power, to cause the desolating war to cease by the
calling of a National Convention, in which all the States<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span>
should be represented in their sovereign capacity; and that,
to that end, an immediate armistice should be declared of sufficient
duration to give the States and the people ample time
and opportunity to deliberate upon and finally conclude a
form of Union.</p>

<p>There were two factions represented at Chicago: one, unqualifiedly
in favor of peace at any price, upon any terms,
with any concessions; the other, disposed to take every possible
advantage of the mistakes of the Administration, but
not possessed of effrontery sufficient to pronounce boldly for
a cessation of hostilities in any and every event.</p>

<p>Thus embarrassed, what was left of the still great Democratic
party&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;that party which had swayed the country
for so many years, and whose disruption in 1860 was the immediate
occasion of the war that ensued&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;determined to do what
it never before, in all its history, had ventured upon. It
essayed to ride, at one and the same time, two horses going
in diametrically opposite directions.</p>

<p>To conciliate whatever feeling in favor of a prosecution of
the war there might be in their ranks, without at the same
time going too far in that direction, and to secure as many
soldiers&#8217; votes as possible, they put in nomination for the
Presidency, Gen. McClellan. To neutralize this apparent
tendency toward war, they associated the General with George
H. Pendleton, of Ohio, as a candidate for the Vice-Presidency&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;a
man, who, during his entire Congressional career as
member of the National House of Representatives, had avowed
himself and voted as a Peace-at-any-price individual, from the
very outset.</p>

<p>The bane and antidote having thus been blended, as only
political chemists would have attempted, the candidates were
placed upon a platform, the second resolution of which was as
follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span></p><blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<i>Resolved</i>, That this Convention does explicitly declare, as
the sense of the American people, that, after four years of
failure to restore the Union by the experiment of war, during
which under the pretence of a military necessity or war
power higher than the Constitution, the Constitution itself
has been disregarded in every part, and public liberty and
private right alike trodden down, and the material prosperity
of the country essentially impaired, justice, humanity,
liberty, and the public welfare demand that immediate efforts
be made for a cessation of hostilities, with a view to an ultimate
Convention of all the States, or other peaceable means,
to the end that at the earliest practicable moment peace
may be restored on the basis of the Federal Union of the
States.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>This accomplished, the Convention adjourned, having provided
for its indefinite existence by empowering its chairman
to reconvene it, whenever, in his judgment, it should be
thought necessary.</p>

<p>McClellan accepted the nomination, happy to know that
when it was made, the record of his public life was kept in
view. In his letter of acceptance, he talked all around the
peace proposition, ignored the idea of a cessation of hostilities,
and went for the whole Union. The document, though sufficiently
general and indefinite to answer the purpose, failed
to satisfy the ultra-peace men of his party.</p>

<p>Thus, in the midst of a civil war, unparalleled in the
world&#8217;s history, the extraordinary spectacle was presented of
a great people entering with earnestness upon a political
campaign, one of whose issues&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;indeed, the main one&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;was
as to the continuance of that war, with all its hardships and
burdens.</p>

<p>Just after the adjournment of the Chicago Convention
Sherman&#8217;s occupation of Atlanta and the capture of the forts
in the harbor of Mobile, were announced, seeming to intimate
that the war had not been, up to that time, wholly a failure.
The thanks of the Nation were tendered by the President to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span>
the officers and men connected with these operations, national
salutes ordered, and the following proclamation issued, dated
September 3d, 1864.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;The signal success that Divine Providence has recently
vouchsafed to the operations of the United States fleet and
army in the harbor of Mobile, and the reduction of Fort
Powell, Fort Gaines, and Fort Morgan, and the glorious
achievements of the army under Major-General Sherman, in
the State of Georgia, resulting in the capture of the city of
Atlanta, call for devout acknowledgment of the Supreme
Being in whose hands are the destinies of nations.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is therefore requested that on next Sunday, in all
places of worship in the United States, thanksgiving be
offered to Him for His mercy in preserving our national
existence against the insurgent rebels who have been waging
a cruel war against the Government of the United States for
its overthrow, and also that prayer be made for Divine protection
to our brave soldiers and their leaders in the field,
who have so often and so gallantly perilled their lives in
battling with the enemy, and for blessing and comfort from
the Father of Mercies to the sick, wounded, and prisoners,
and to the orphans and widows of those who have fallen in
the service of their country, and that He will continue to
uphold the Government of the United States against all the
efforts of public enemies and secret foes.</p>

<p class="sigright">
&#8220;<span class="smcap">Abraham Lincoln.</span>&#8221;<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. Lincoln&#8217;s views relative to the employment of negroes
as soldiers were again and fully expressed about this time in
a conversation with leading gentlemen from the West. On
that occasion he said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;The slightest knowledge of arithmetic will prove to any
man that the rebel armies cannot be destroyed by Democratic
strategy. It would sacrifice all the white men of the North
to do it. There are now in the service of the United States<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span>
nearly two hundred thousand able-bodied colored men, most
of them under arms, defending and acquiring Union territory.
The Democratic strategy demands that these forces be disbanded,
and that the masters be conciliated by restoring them
to slavery. The black men, who now assist Union prisoners
to escape, are to be converted into our enemies, in the vain
hope of gaining the good-will of their masters. We shall have
to fight two nations instead of one.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can not conciliate the South, if you guarantee to
them ultimate success; and the experience of the present
war proves their success is inevitable, if you fling the compulsory
labor of millions of black men into their side of the
scale. Will you give our enemies such military advantages
as insure success, and then depend upon coaxing, flattery,
and concession to get them back into the Union? Abandon
all the forts now garrisoned by black men, take two hundred
thousand men from our side and put them in the battle-field
or corn-field against us, and we would be compelled to abandon
the war in three weeks.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have to hold territory in inclement and sickly places;
where are the Democrats to do this? It was a free fight;
and the field was open to the War Democrats to put down
this rebellion by fighting against both master and slave, long
before the present policy was inaugurated.</p>

<p>&#8220;There have been men base enough to propose to me to
return to slavery our black warriors of Port Hudson and
Olustee, and thus win the respect of the masters they fought.
Should I do so, I should deserve to be damned in time and
eternity. Come what will, I will keep my faith with friend
and foe. My enemies pretend I am now carrying on this
war for the sole purpose of abolition. So long as I am
President, it shall be carried on for the sole purpose of restoring
the Union. But no human power can subdue this rebellion
without the use of the Emancipation policy, and every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span>
other policy calculated to weaken the moral and physical
forces of the rebellion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Freedom has given us two hundred thousand men raised
on Southern soil. It will give us more yet. Just so much
it has subtracted from the enemy; and, instead of checking
the South, there are now evidences of a fraternal feeling
growing up between our men and the rank and file of the
rebel soldiers. Let my enemies prove to the country that
the destruction of slavery is not necessary to the restoration
of the Union. I will abide the issue.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>On the 19th of October, the President having been serenaded
by the loyal Marylanders of the District of Columbia,
said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;I am notified that this is a compliment paid me by the
loyal Marylanders resident in this district. I infer that the
adoption of the new Constitution for the State furnishes the
occasion, and that in your view the extirpation of slavery
constitutes the chief merit of the new Constitution.</p>

<p>&#8220;Most heartily do I congratulate you, and Maryland, and
the Nation, and the world upon the event. I regret that it
did not occur two years sooner, which, I am sure, would have
saved to the nation more money than would have met all the
private loss incident to the measure; but it has come at last,
and I sincerely hope its friends may fully realize all their
anticipations of good from it, and that its opponents may, by
its effects, be agreeably and profitably disappointed.</p>

<p>&#8220;A word upon another subject: Something said by the
Secretary of State in his recent speech at Auburn, has been
construed by some into a threat that, if I shall be beaten at
the election, I will between then and the end of my constitutional
term do what I may be able to ruin the Government.
Others regard the fact that the Chicago Convention adjourned,
not <i>sine die</i>, but to meet again, if called to do so by a particular
individual, as the ultimatum of a purpose that, if the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span>
nominee shall be elected, he will at once seize control of the
Government.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope the good people will permit themselves to suffer
no uneasiness on either point. I am struggling to maintain
the Government, not to overthrow it. I therefore say that,
if I shall live, I shall remain President until the fourth of
March. And whoever shall be constitutionally elected, therefore,
in November, shall be duly installed as President on the
fourth of March; and that, in the interval, I shall do my
utmost that whoever is to hold the helm for the next voyage,
shall start with the best possible chance to save the ship.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is due to our people, both on principle and under
the Constitution. Their will, constitutionally expressed, is
the ultimate law for all. If they should deliberately resolve
to have immediate peace, even at the loss of their country
and their liberties, I know not the power or the right to
resist them. It is their own business, and they must do as
they please with their own.</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe, however, that they are all resolved to preserve
their country and their liberty; and in this, in office or out
of it, I am resolved to stand by them. I may add, that in
this purpose&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;to save the country and its liberties&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;no class
of people seem so nearly unanimous as the soldiers in the field
and the seamen afloat. Do they not have the hardest of it?
Who shall quail, when they do not? God bless the soldiers
and seamen and all their brave commanders!&#8221;</p></blockquote>

of Congress&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;Last Annual Message.</p></blockquote>

<p>The Presidential campaign of 1864, was, in several of its
aspects, an anomaly. The amount of low blackguard and
slang dealt out against the Administration, was perhaps to
have been expected in a land where personal abuse seems to
have become regarded as so vital an accompaniment of a
National Election, that its absence in any exciting canvass
would give rise to grave fears that positive Constitutional
requirements had been disregarded.</p>

<p>Though freedom, in such instances, far too often is wrested
into the vilest abuse, it was in truth passing strange that an
Administration should be so violently assailed by its opponents
as despotic and tyrannical, when the very fact that such
strictures and comments were passed upon it, without let or
hindrance, by word of mouth and on the printed page,
afforded a proof that the despotism, if such there were, was
either too mild or too weak to enforce even a decent treatment
of itself and its acts. It is safe to say, that, within the
limits of that section with which we were under any circumstances
to establish harmonious and peaceful relations,
according to the requirements of the opposition, not one
speech in a hundred, not one editorial in a thousand, would
have been permitted under precisely similar circumstances.</p>

<p>General Fremont withdrew his name shortly after the
Chicago nominations, that he might not distract and divide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span>
the friends of the Union. In his letter of withdrawal he
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;The policy of the Democratic party signifies either separation,
or reëstablishment, with slavery. The Chicago platform
is simply separation. General McClellan&#8217;s letter of
acceptance, is reëstablishment with slavery.... The
Republican candidate, on the contrary, is pledged to the reëstablishment
of Union without slavery.&#8221;</p>

<p>Senator Wade and Henry Winter Davis, who had joined
in a manifesto to the people, bitterly denunciatory of the
President&#8217;s course in issuing his reconstruction proclamation,
entered manfully into the canvass in behalf of the Baltimore
nominees. The ranks of the supporters of the Government
closed steadily up, and pressed on to a success, of which they
could not, with their faith in manhood and republican principles,
suffer themselves to doubt.</p>

<p>The Opposition were not entirely in accord. It was a delicate
position in which the full-blooded Peace Democrat found
himself, obliged as he was to endorse a man whose only claim
for the nomination was the reputation which he had made as
a prominent General engaged in prosecuting an &#8220;unnatural,
unholy war.&#8221; Nor did it afford much alleviation to his distress
to remember that this candidate had been loudly assailed
in the Convention as the first mover in the matter of arbitrary
arrests, against which a sturdy outcry had long been raised
by himself and friends. It was unpleasant, moreover, not to
be able to forget that the same candidate had been the first to
suggest a draft&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;or &#8220;conscription,&#8221; as your true peace man
would call it: that measure so full of horrors, against which
unconstitutional act such an amount of indignation had been
expended.</p>

<p>Nor was the situation of the War Democrat, if he were
indeed honestly and sincerely such, much better. He could
not shut his eyes to the fact, that his candidate&#8217;s military
record, whatever else it might have established, did not evince<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327</a></span>
very remarkable vigor and celerity in his movements, as compared
with other Generals then and since prominently before
the public. Even had he blundered energetically, in that
there would have been some consolation. The thought, not
unpleasant to the Pendletonian, of the possibility of the
General&#8217;s death during his term of office, stirred up certain
other thoughts which he would rather have avoided.</p>

<p>However, it must be said, that, taken as a whole, the
Opposition came up to the work more vigorously than might
have been supposed, and carried on their campaign in as
blustering and defiant a style as if victory were sure to perch
upon their banners. There was the usual amount of cheap
enthusiasm, valiant betting, and an unusual amount, many
thought, of cheating&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;at least, the results of investigations at
Baltimore and Washington, conducted by a military tribunal,
to a casual observer appeared to squint in that direction.</p>

<p>Richmond papers were, for a marvel, quite unanimous in
the desire that Mr. Lincoln should not be reëlected. The
rebel Vice-President declared that the Chicago movement was
&#8220;the only ray of light which had come from the North during
the war.&#8221; European sympathizers with the rebellion, likewise,
were opposed to Mr. Lincoln&#8217;s reëlection, and their
organs on the Continent and in the provinces did their best to
abuse him shockingly.</p>

<p>The State elections in Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Indiana,
occurring in October, created much consternation in the opposition
ranks&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;that in the latter State particularly, which had
been set down positively as upon their side, but insisted, upon
that occasion, in common with the first two in pronouncing
unequivocally in favor of the Administration candidates.</p>

<p>The result could no longer be doubtful. Yet the most of
the supporters of McClellan kept up their talk, whatever
their thoughts may have been.</p>

<p>No opportunity for talk, even, was afforded when the
results of the election of November 8th became known.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">328</a></span>
Abraham Lincoln and Andrew Johnson&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;whom an opposition
journal, with rarest refinement and graceful courtesy, concentrating
all its malignity into the intensest sentence possible,
had characterized as &#8220;a rail-splitting buffoon and a
boorish tailor, both from the backwoods, both growing
up in uncouth ignorance&#8221;&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;these men of the people carried
every loyal State, except Kentucky, New Jersey, and Delaware,
the vote of soldiers in service having been almost
universally given to them.</p>

<p>Of the four million, thirty-four thousand, seven hundred
and eighty-nine votes cast, Mr. Lincoln received, according
to official returns, two million, two hundred and twenty-three
thousand, and thirty-five; a majority on the aggregate
popular vote, of four hundred and eleven thousand, two
hundred and eighty-one.</p>

<p>The President elect by a plurality in 1860, he was reëlected
in 1864 by a majority decisive and unmistakable.</p>

<p>Having been serenaded early in the morning following his
reëlection, by Pennsylvanians then in Washington, he thus
gave utterance to his feelings:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Friends and Fellow-Citizens</span>:&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;Even before I had been
informed by you that this compliment was paid me by
loyal citizens of Pennsylvania friendly to me, I had inferred
that you were of that portion of my countrymen who think
that the best interests of the nation are to be subserved
by the support of the present administration. I do not pretend
to say that you, who think so, embrace all the patriotism
and loyalty of the country; but I do believe, and I trust
without personal interest, that the welfare of the country does
require that such support and indorsement be given. I
earnestly believe that the consequences of this day&#8217;s work if
it be as you assume, and as now seems probable, will be
to the lasting advantage if not to the very salvation of the
country. I cannot, at this hour, say what has been the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span>
result of the election, but whatever it may be, I have no
desire to modify this opinion: that all who have labored to-day
in behalf of the Union organization, have wrought
for the best interest of their country and the world, not only
for the present, but for all future ages. I am thankful to God
for this approval of the people; but while deeply grateful
for this mark of their confidence in me, if I know my heart,
my gratitude is free from any taint of personal triumph. I
do not impugn the motives of any one opposed to me. It is
no pleasure to me to triumph over any one, but I give thanks
to the Almighty for this evidence of the people&#8217;s resolution
to stand by free government and the rights of humanity.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>When the result was definitely known, at a serenade given
in his honor on the night of November 10th, by the various
Lincoln and Johnson Clubs of the District, he said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;It has long been a grave question whether any Government,
not too strong for the liberties of its people, can
be strong enough to maintain its existence in great emergencies.
On this point the present rebellion brought our
Government to a severe test, and a Presidential election
occurring in a regular course during the rebellion, added not
a little to the strain.</p>

<p>&#8220;If the loyal people united were put to the utmost of their
strength by the rebellion, must they not fail when divided and
partially paralyzed by a political war among themselves?
But the election was a necessity&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;we can not have free
government without elections; and if the rebellion could force
us to forego or postpone a national election, it must fairly
claim to have already conquered and ruined us. The strife
of the election is but human nature practically applied to the
facts of the case. What has occurred in this case must ever
recur in similar cases. Human nature will not change. In
any future great national trial, compared with the men of
this, we shall have as weak and as strong, as silly and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span>
as wise, as bad and as good. Let us, therefore, study the
incidents of this, as philosophy to learn wisdom from;
and none of them as wrongs to be revenged.</p>

<p>&#8220;But the election, along with its incidental and undesirable
strife, has done good too. It has demonstrated that a
people&#8217;s government can sustain a national election in the
midst of a great civil war. Until now it has not been known
to the world that this was a possibility. It shows also how
sound and how strong we still are. It shows that, even
among the candidates of the same party, he who is most
devoted to the Union, and most opposed to treason, can
receive most of the people&#8217;s votes. It shows also, to the
extent yet known, that we have more men now than we had
when the war began. Gold is good in its place; but living,
brave, and patriotic men are better than gold.</p>

<p>&#8220;But the rebellion continues; and now that the election is
over, may not all having a common interest reunite in a common
effort to save our common country? For my own part,
I have striven and shall strive to avoid placing any obstacle
in the way. So long as I have been here I have not willingly
planted a thorn in any man&#8217;s bosom. While I am duly
sensible to the high compliment of a reëlection, and duly
grateful, as I trust, to Almighty God for having directed my
countrymen to a right conclusion, as I think, for their good,
it adds nothing to my satisfaction that any other man may
be disappointed by the result.</p>

<p>&#8220;May I ask those who have not differed with me to join
with me in this same spirit toward those who have? And
now let me close by asking three hearty cheers for our brave
soldiers and seamen and their gallant and skilful commanders.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>As indicative of Mr. Lincoln&#8217;s warmth and tenderness of
heart the following letter will be read with interest. It was
addressed to a poor widow, in Boston, whose sixth son, then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">331</a></span>
recently wounded, was lying in a hospital and bears date
November 21st, 1864.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Dear Madam</span>:&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;I have been shown in the files of the
War Department a statement of the Adjutant-General of
Massachusetts, that you are the mother of five sons who have
died gloriously on the field of battle. I feel how weak and
fruitless must be any word of mine, which should attempt to
beguile you from the grief of a loss so overwhelming; but I
cannot refrain from tendering to you the consolation that may
be found in the thanks of the Republic they died to save. I
pray that our Heavenly Father may assuage the anguish of
your bereavement, and leave you only the cherished memory
of the loved and lost, and the solemn pride that must be
yours, to have laid so costly a sacrifice upon the altar of
Freedom.</p>

<div class="sigright">
<span class="l2">&#8220;Yours very sincerely and respectfully,</span><br />
&#8220;<span class="smcap">Abraham Lincoln</span>.&#8221;
</div></blockquote>

<p>The Thirty-eighth Congress commenced its second session
on the 5th of December, 1864. On the following day Mr.
Lincoln transmitted what was to be his last annual message:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Fellow-citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives</span>:&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;Again
the blessings of health and abundant
harvests claim our profoundest gratitude to Almighty God.</p>

<p>&#8220;The condition of our foreign affairs is reasonably satisfactory.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mexico continues to be a theatre of civil war. While our
political relations with that country have undergone no
change, we have at the same time strictly maintained neutrality
between the belligerents.</p>

<p>&#8220;At the request of the States of Costa Rica and Nicaragua,
a competent engineer has been authorized to make a survey
of the river San Juan and the port of San Juan. It is a
source of much satisfaction that the difficulties, which for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">332</a></span>
moment excited some political apprehension, and caused a
closing of the inter-oceanic transit route, have been amicably
adjusted, and that there is a good prospect that the route will
soon be re-opened with an increase of capacity and adaptation.</p>

<p>&#8220;We could not exaggerate either the commercial or the
political importance of that great improvement. It would be
doing injustice to an important South American State not to
acknowledge the directness, frankness, and cordiality with
which the United States of Columbia has entered into intimate
relation with this Government. A Claim Convention has
been constituted to complete the unfinished work of the one
which closed its session in 1861.</p>

<p>&#8220;The new liberal Constitution of Venezuela having gone
into effect with the universal acquiescence of the people, the
Government under it has been recognised, and diplomatic intercourse
with it has been opened in a cordial and friendly
spirit.</p>

<p>&#8220;The long-deferred Avis Island claim has been satisfactorily
paid and discharged. Mutual payments have been
made of the claims awarded by the late Joint Commission for
the settlement of claims between the United States and Peru.
An earnest and candid friendship continues to exist between
the two countries; and such efforts as were in my power have
been used to prevent misunderstanding, and avert a threatened
war between Peru and Spain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our relations are of the most friendly nature with Chili,
the Argentine Republic, Bolivia, Costa Rica, Paraguay, San
Salvador, and Hayti. During the past year, no differences
of any kind have arisen with any of these Republics. And,
on the other hand, their sympathies with the United States
are constantly expressed with cordiality and earnestness.</p>

<p>&#8220;The claims arising from the seizure of the cargo of the
brig Macedonian, in 1821, have been paid in full by the Government
of Chili.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">333</a></span>
&#8220;Civil war continues in the Spanish port of San Domingo,
apparently without prospect of an early close.</p>

<p>&#8220;Official correspondence has been freely opened with
Liberia, and it gives us a pleasing view of social and political
progress in that Republic. It may be expected to derive new
vigor from American influence, improved by the rapid disappearance
of slavery in the United States.</p>

<p>&#8220;I solicit your authority to promise to the Republic a gunboat,
at a moderate cost, to be reimbursed to the United
States by instalments. Such a vessel is needed for the safety
of that State against the native African races, and in Liberian
hands it would be more effective in arresting the African
slave-trade than a squadron in our own hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;The possession of the least authorized naval force would
stimulate a generous ambition in the Republic, and the confidence
which we should manifest by furnishing it would win
forbearance and favor toward the colony from all civilized
nations. The proposed overland telegraph between America
and Europe by the way of Behring Strait and Asiatic Russia,
which was sanctioned by Congress at the last session, has
been undertaken under very favorable circumstances by an
association of American citizens, with the cordial good will
and support as well of this Government as of those of Great
Britain and Russia.</p>

<p>&#8220;Assurances have been received from most of the South
American States of their high appreciation of the enterprise
and their readiness to coöperate in constructing lines tributary
to that world-encircling communication.</p>

<p>&#8220;I learn with much satisfaction that the noble design of a
telegraphic communication between the eastern coast of
America and Great Britain has been renewed with full expectation
of its early accomplishment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thus it is hoped that with the return of domestic peace
the country will be able to resume with energy and advantage
her former high career of commerce and civilization.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">334</a></span>
Our very popular and able representative in Egypt died in
April last.</p>

<p>&#8220;An unpleasant altercation which arose between the temporary
incumbent and the Government of the Pacha, resulted
in a suspension of intercourse. The evil was promptly corrected
on the arrival of the successor in the consulate, and
our relations with Egypt as well as our relations with the
Barbary Powers, are entirely satisfactory.</p>

<p>&#8220;The rebellion which has so long been flagrant in China,
has at last been suppressed with the coöperating good offices
of this Government and of the other Western Commercial
States. The judicial consular establishment has become very
difficult and onerous, and it will need legislative requisition
to adapt it to the extension of our commerce, and to the more
intimate intercourse which has been instituted with the Government
and people of that vast empire.</p>

<p>&#8220;China seems to be accepting with hearty good-will the
conventional laws which regulate commerce and social intercourse
among the Western nations.</p>

<p>&#8220;Owing to the peculiar situation of Japan, and the anomalous
form of its Government, the action of that Empire in
performing treaty stipulations is inconsistent and capricious.
Nevertheless good progress has been effected by the Western
Powers, moving with enlightened concert. Our own pecuniary
claims have been allowed, or put in course of settlement,
and the Inland Sea has been reopened to Commerce.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is reason also to believe that these proceedings
have increased rather than diminished the friendship of Japan
toward the United States.</p>

<p>&#8220;The ports of Norfolk, Fernandino, and Pensacola have
been opened by proclamation.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is hoped that foreign merchants will now consider
whether it is not safer and more profitable to themselves as
well as just to the United States, to resort to these and other
open ports, than it is to pursue, through many hazards and at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a></span>
vast cost, a contraband trade with other ports which are
closed, if not by actual military operations, at least by a lawful
and effective blockade.</p>

<p>&#8220;For myself, I have no doubt of the power and duty of
the Executive, under the laws of nations, to exclude enemies
of the human race from an asylum in the United States. If
Congress should think that proceedings in such cases lack the
authority of law, or ought to be further regulated by it, I recommend
that provision be made for effectually preventing
foreign slave-traders from acquiring domicil and facilities for
their criminal occupation in our country.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is possible that if this were a new and open question,
the maritime powers, with the light they now enjoy, would
not concede the privileges of a naval belligerent to the insurgents
of the United States, destitute as they are and always
have been, equally of ships, and of ports and harbors.</p>

<p>&#8220;Disloyal enemies have been neither less assiduous nor
more successful during the last year than they were before
that time, in their efforts, under favor of that privilege, to
embroil our country in foreign wars. The desire and determination
of the maritime States to defeat that design are believed
to be as sincere as, and cannot be more earnest than
our own.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nevertheless, unforseen political difficulties have arisen,
especially in Brazilian and British ports, and on the Northern
boundary of the United States, which have required and are
likely to continue to require the practice of constant vigilance,
and a just and conciliatory spirit on the part of the United
States, as well as of the nations concerned and their Governments.
Commissioners have been appointed under the treaty
with Great Britain, in the adjustment of the claims of the
Hudson&#8217;s Bay and Puget Sound Agricultural Companies in
Oregon, and are now proceeding to the execution of the trust
assigned to them.</p>

<p>&#8220;In view of the insecurity of life in the region adjacent to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a></span>
the Canadian border by recent assaults and depredations
committed by inimical and desperate persons who are harbored
there, it has been thought proper to give notice that
after the expiration of six months, the period conditionally
stipulated in the existing arrangements with Great Britain,
the United States must hold themselves at liberty to increase
their naval armament upon the lakes, if they shall find that
proceeding necessary.</p>

<p>&#8220;The condition of the Border will necessarily come into
consideration in connection with the continuing or modifying
the rights of transit from Canada through the United States,
as well as the regulation of imposts, which were temporarily
established by the Reciprocity Treaty of the 5th of June,
1864. I desire, however, to be understood while making
this statement that the Colonial authorities are not deemed
to be intentionally unjust or unfriendly toward the United
States; but, on the contrary, there is every reason to
expect that, with the approval of the Imperial Government,
they will take the necessary measures to prevent new incursions
across the border.</p>

<p>&#8220;The act passed at the last session for the encouragement
of immigration has, as far as was possible, been put into
operation.</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems to need an amendment which will enable the
officers of the Government to prevent the practice of frauds
against the immigrants while on their way and on their arrival
in the ports, so as to secure them here a free choice of avocations
and place of settlement.</p>

<p>&#8220;A liberal disposition toward this great National policy is
manifested by most of the European States, and ought to be
reciprocated on our part by giving the immigrants effective
National protection. I regard our immigrants as one of the
principal replenishing streams which are appointed by Providence
to repair the ravages of internal war, and its wastes of
National strength and health.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">337</a></span>
&#8220;All that is necessary is, to secure the flow of that stream
in its present fullness, and to that end, the Government must,
in every way, make it manifest that it neither needs nor designs
to impose involuntary military service upon those who
come from other lands to cast their lot in our country.</p>

<p>&#8220;The financial affairs of the Government have been successfully
administered. During the last year the legislation
of the last session of Congress has beneficially affected the
revenue, although sufficient time has not yet elapsed to experience
the full effect of several of the provisions of the act
of Congress imposing increased taxation. The receipts during
the year, from all sources, upon the basis of warrants signed
by the Secretary of the Treasury, including loans and the
balance in the Treasury on the first day of July, 1863, were
$1,394,796,007 62, and the aggregate disbursements, upon
the same basis, were $1,298,056,101 89, leaving a balance in
the Treasury, as shown by warrants, of $96,739,905 73.
Deduct from these amounts the amount of the principal of the
public debt redeemed, and the amount of issues in substitution
therefor, and the actual cash operations of the Treasury
were: Receipts, $3,075,646 77; disbursements, $865,734,087 76;
which leaves a cash balance in the Treasury of $18,842,558 71.
Of the receipts, there were derived from customs,
$102,316,152 99; from lands, $588,333 29; from direct taxes,
$475,648 96; from internal revenues, $109,741,134 10; from
miscellaneous sources, $47,511,448; and from loans applied
to actual expenditures, including former balance, $623,443,929 13.
There were disbursed for the civil service, $27,505,599 46;
for pensions and Indians, $7,517,930 97; for the
War Department, $60,791,842 97; for the Navy Department,
$85,733,292 79; for interest of the public debts, $53,685,421 69;
making an aggregate of $865,234,081 86, and leaving a
balance in the Treasury of $18,842,558 71, as before stated.</p>

<p>&#8220;For the actual receipts and disbursements for the first
quarter, and the estimated receipts and disbursements for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span>
three remaining quarters of the current fiscal year, and the
general operations of the Treasury in detail, I refer you to
the report of the Secretary of the Treasury.</p>

<p>&#8220;I concur with him in the opinion, that the proportion of
the moneys required to meet the expenses consequent upon
the war derived from taxation, should be still further increased;
and I earnestly invite your attention to this subject,
to the end that there may be such additional legislation
as shall be required to meet the just expectations of the
Secretary.</p>

<p>&#8220;The public debt, on the first day of May last, as appears
by the books of the Treasury, amounted to $1,740,690,489 49.
Probably, should the war continue for another year, that
amount may be increased by not far from five hundred
millions. Held, as it is for the most part, by our own people,
it has become a substantial branch of national, though private
property.</p>

<p>&#8220;For obvious reasons, the more nearly this property can
be distributed among all the people, the better. To forward
general distribution, greater inducements to become owners,
might, perhaps, with good effect and without injury, be presented
to persons of limited means. With this view, I suggest
whether it might not be both expedient and competent
for Congress to provide that a limited amount of some future
issue of public securities might be held, by any <i>bonâ fide</i>
purchaser, exempt from taxation and from seizure for debt,
under such restrictions and limitations as might be necessary
to guard against abuse of so important a privilege. This
would enable prudent persons to set aside a small annuity
against a possible day of want.</p>

<p>&#8220;Privileges like these would render the possession of such
securities, to the amount limited, most desirable to every
person of small means who might be able to save enough for
the purpose. The great advantage of citizens being creditors
as well as debtors, is obvious. Men readily perceive that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">339</a></span>
they cannot be much oppressed by a debt which they owe to
themselves.</p>

<p>&#8220;The public debt on the first day of July last, although
somewhat exceeding the estimate of the Secretary of the
Treasury made to Congress at the commencement of last session,
falls short of the estimate of that office made in the
succeeding December as to its probable amount at the beginning
of this year, by the sum of $3,995,079 33. This fact
exhibits a satisfactory condition and conduct of the operations
of the Treasury.</p>

<p>&#8220;The National banking system is proving to be acceptable
to capitalists and the people. On the 25th day of November,
five hundred and eighty-four National Banks had been
organized, a considerable number of which were conversions
from State banks. Changes from the State system to the
National system are rapidly taking place, and it is hoped that
very soon there will be in the United States no banks of
issue not authorized by Congress, and no bank-note circulation
not secured by the government. That the government
and the people will derive general benefit from this change in
the banking system of the country can hardly be questioned.</p>

<p>&#8220;The National system will create a reliable and permanent
influence in support of the national credit, and protect
the people against losses in the use of paper money. Whether
or not any further legislation is advisable for the suppression
of State bank issues, it will be for Congress to determine. It
seems quite clear that the Treasury cannot be satisfactorily
conducted unless the government can exercise restraining
power over the bank-note circulation of the country.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Report of the Secretary of War, and the accompanying
documents, will detail the campaigns of the armies in the
field since the date of the last annual Message, and also the
operations of the several administrative bureaus of the War
Department during the last year.</p>

<p>&#8220;It will also specify the measures deemed essential for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">340</a></span>
national defence, and to keep up and supply the requisite
military force.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Report of the Secretary of the Navy presents a
comprehensive and satisfactory exhibit of the affairs of that
department and of the naval service. It is a subject of congratulation
and laudable pride to our countrymen, that a
navy of such vast proportions has been organized in so brief
a period and conducted with so much efficiency and success.</p>

<p>&#8220;The general exhibits of the Navy, including vessels under
construction, on the first of December, 1864, shows a total
of 671 vessels, carrying 4,610 guns, and 510,396 tons&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;being
an actual increase during the year over and above all losses
by shipwreck or in battle, of 83 vessels, 167 guns, and 42,427
tons. The total number at this time in the naval service,
including officers, is about 51,000. There have been captured
by the Navy during the year, 324 vessels, and the whole number
of naval captures since hostilities commenced is 1,379,
of which 267 are steamers. The gross proceeds arising from
the sale of condemned prize property, thus far reported,
amount to $14,396,250 51.</p>

<p>&#8220;A large amount of such proceeds is still under adjudication
and yet to be reported. The total expenditures of the
Navy Department, of every description, including the cost of
the immense squadrons that have been called into existence,
from the 4th of March, 1861, to the 1st of November, 1864,
are $238,647,262 35. Your favorable consideration is invited
to the various recommendations of the Secretary of the
Navy, especially in regard to a navy yard and suitable establishment
for the construction and repair of iron vessels, and
the machinery and armature for our ships, to which reference
was made in my last annual message.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your attention is also invited to the views expressed in
the report in relation to the legislation of Congress at its last
session in respect to prizes on our inland waters.</p>

<p>&#8220;I cordially concur in the recommendation of the Secretary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">341</a></span>
as to the propriety of creating the new rank of Vice-admiral
in our naval service.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your attention is invited to the report of the Postmaster-General,
for a detailed account of the operations and financial
condition of the Post-Office Department. The postal revenues
for the year ending June 30, 1864, amounted to $12,438,253 78,
and the expenditures to $12,644,786 20; the excess of expenditures
over receipts being $206,532 42.</p>

<p>&#8220;The views presented by the Postmaster-General on the
subject of special grants by the Government in aid of the establishment
of new lines of ocean mail steamships, and the
policy he recommends for the development of increased commercial
intercourse with adjacent and neighboring countries,
should receive the careful consideration of Congress.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is of noteworthy interest that the steady expansion of
population, improvement and governmental institutions over
the new and unoccupied portions of our country have scarcely
been checked, much less impeded or destroyed by our great
civil war, which, at first glance, would seem to have absorbed
almost the entire energies of the Nation.</p>

<p>&#8220;The organization and admission of the State of Nevada
has been completed in conformity with law, and thus our
excellent system is firmly established in the mountains which
once seemed a barren and uninhabitable waste between the
Atlantic States and those which have grown up on the coast
of the Pacific Ocean.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Territories of the Union are generally in a condition
of prosperity and growth. Idaho and Montana, by reason of
their great distance and the interruption of communication
with them by Indian hostilities, have been only partially
organized; but it is understood that those difficulties are
about to disappear, which will permit their governments, like
those of the others, to go into speedy and full operation.</p>

<p>&#8220;As intimately connected with and promotive of this material
growth of the Nation, I ask the attention of Congress to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">342</a></span>
the valuable information and important recommendation relating
to the public lands, Indian affairs, the Pacific Railroad,
and mineral discoveries contained in the report of the Secretary
of the Interior, which is herewith transmitted, and which
report also embraces the subjects of the patents, pensions,
and other topics of public interest pertaining to his Department.</p>

<p>&#8220;The quantity of public land disposed of during the five
quarters ending on the 30th of September last, was 4,221,342
acres, of which 1,538,614 acres were entered under the Homestead
law. The remainder was located with military land
warrants, agricultural script certified to States for railroads,
and sold for cash. The cash received from sales and location
fees was $1,019,446. The income from sales during the fiscal
year ending June 30, 1864, was $678,007 21, against
$136,077 95, received during the preceding year. The aggregate
number of acres surveyed during the year has been equal
to the quantity disposed of, and there are open to settlement
about 133,000,000 acres of surveyed land.</p>

<p>&#8220;The great enterprise of connecting the Atlantic with the
Pacific States by railways and telegraph lines has been entered
upon with a vigor that gives assurance of success, notwithstanding
the embarrassments arising from the prevailing high
prices of materials and labor. The route of the main line of
the road has been definitely located for one hundred miles
westward from the initial point at Omaha City, Nebraska,
and a preliminary location of the Pacific Railroad of California
has been made from Sacramento eastward to the great
bend of Mucker river, in Nevada. Numerous discoveries of
gold, silver and cinnabar mines have been added to the many
heretofore known, and the country occupied by the Sierra
Nevada and Rocky Mountains and the subordinate ranges
now teems with enterprising labor which is richly remunerative.
It is believed that the products of the mines of precious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">343</a></span>
metals in that region have, during the year reached, if not
exceeded, $100,000,000 in value.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was recommended in my last annual message, that our
Indian system be remodeled. Congress, at its last session,
acting upon the recommendation, did provide for reorganizing
the system in California, and it is believed that under the
present organization the management of the Indians there
will be attended with reasonable success. Much yet remains
to be done to provide for the proper government of the Indians
in other parts of the country, to render it secure for the advancing
settler and to provide for the welfare of the Indian.
The Secretary reiterates his recommendations, and to them
the attention of Congress is invited.</p>

<p>&#8220;The liberal provisions made by Congress for paying
pensions to invalid soldiers and sailors of the Republic, and
to the widows, orphans and dependent mothers of those who
have fallen in battle, or died of disease contracted, or of
wounds received in the service of their country, have been
diligently administered.</p>

<p>&#8220;There have been added to the pension rolls during the
year ending the thirtieth day of June last, the names of 16,770
invalid soldiers, and of 271 disabled seamen, making the
present number of army invalid pensioners 22,767, and of
navy invalid pensioners 712. Of widows, orphans and
mothers, 22,198 have been placed on the army pension rolls,
and 248 on the navy rolls.</p>

<p>&#8220;The present number of Army pensioners of this class is
25,433, and of Navy pensioners 793. At the beginning of
the year, the number of revolutionary pensioners was 1,430.
Only twelve of them were soldiers, of whom seven have since
died. The remainder are those who, under the law, receive
pensions because of relationship to revolutionary soldiers.</p>

<p>&#8220;During the year ending the thirtieth of June, 1864,
$4,504,616 92 have been paid to pensioners of all classes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I cheerfully commend to your continued patronage the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">344</a></span>
benevolent institutions of the District of Columbia, which
have hitherto been established or fostered by Congress, and
respectfully refer for information concerning them, and in
relation to the Washington Aqueduct, the Capitol, and other
matters of local interest to the report of the Secretary.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Agricultural Department, under the supervision of
its present energetic and faithful head, is rapidly commending
itself to the great and vital interest it was intended to
advance. It is peculiarly the People&#8217;s Department, in which
they feel more directly concerned than in any other, I commend
it to the continued attention and fostering care of Congress.</p>

<p>&#8220;The war continues. Since the last annual message, all
the important lines and positions then occupied by our forces
have been maintained, and our armies have steadily advanced,
thus liberating the regions left in the rear, so that Missouri,
Kentucky, Tennessee, and parts of other States have again
produced reasonably fair crops.</p>

<p>&#8220;The most remarkable feature in the military operations
of the year, is General Sherman&#8217;s attempted march of three
hundred miles directly through insurgent regions. It tends
to show a great increase of our relative strength, that our
General-in-chief should feel able to confront and hold in check
every active force of the enemy, and yet to detach a well-appointed,
large army to move on such an expedition. The
result not being yet known, conjecture in regard to it is not
here indulged.</p>

<p>&#8220;Important movements have also occurred during the
year to the effect of moulding society for ductility in the
Union. Although short of complete success, it is much in
the right direction that twelve thousand citizens in each of
the States of Arkansas and Louisiana, have organized loyal
State governments with free Constitutions, and are earnestly
struggling to maintain and administer them.</p>

<p>&#8220;The movement in the same direction, more extensive,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">345</a></span>
though less definite, in Missouri, Kentucky, and Tennessee,
should not be overlooked.</p>

<p>&#8220;But Maryland presents the example of complete success.
Maryland is secure to liberty and union for all the future.
The genius of rebellion will no more claim Maryland. Like
another foul spirit, being driven out, it may seek to tear her
but it will rule her no more.</p>

<p>&#8220;At the last Session of Congress, a proposed amendment
of the Constitution abolishing slavery throughout the United
States, passed the Senate, but failed, for lack of the requisite
two-thirds vote in the House of Representatives. Although
the present is the same Congress, and nearly the same
members, and without question on the patriotism of those
who stood in opposition, I venture to recommend the consideration
and passage of the measure at the present session.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course the abstract question is not changed, but an
intervening election shows almost certainly that the next
Congress will pass the measure, if this does not. Hence
there is only a question of time as to when the proposed
amendment will go to the States for their action; and as it is
to go at all events, may we not agree that the sooner the
better? It is not claimed that the election has imposed a
duty on members to change their views or their votes any
further than as an additional element to be considered.
Their judgment may be affected by it.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is the voice of the people, now for the first time heard
upon the question. In a great national crisis like ours,
unanimity of action among those seeking a common end is
very desirable, almost indispensable, and yet an approach to
such unanimity is attainable, only as some deference shall be
paid to the will of the majority, simply because it is the will
of the majority.</p>

<p>&#8220;In this case, the common end is the maintenance of the
Union, and among the means to secure that end, such will,
through the election, is most clearly declared in favor of such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">346</a></span>
Constitutional Amendment. The most reliable indication of
public purpose in this country is derived through our popular
election. Judging by the recent canvass and its result, the
purpose of the people within the loyal States to maintain the
integrity of the Union was never more firm nor more nearly
unanimous than now.</p>

<p>&#8220;The extraordinary calmness and good order with which
the millions of voters met and mingled at the polls, give
strong assurance of this. Not only those who supported the
&#8216;Union Ticket,&#8217; so called, but a great majority of the opposing
party also, may be fairly claimed to entertain and to
be actuated by the same purpose. It is an unanswerable
argument to this effect that no candidate to any office whatever,
high or low, has ventured to seek votes on the avowal
that he was for giving up the Union.</p>

<p>&#8220;There has been much impugning of motives, and heated
controversy as to the proper means and best mode of advancing
the Union cause, but in the distinct issue of Union or no
Union, the politicians have shown their distinctive knowledge
that there is no diversity among the people. In affording
the people a fair opportunity of showing one to another and
to the world this firmness and unanimity of purpose, the
election has been of vast value to the National cause.</p>

<p>&#8220;The election has exhibited another fact not less valuable
to be known in the fact that we do not approach exhaustion
in the most important branch of the national resources, that
of living men. While it is melancholy to reflect that the war
has filled so many graves, and carried mourning to so many
hearts, it is some relief to know that, compared with the surviving,
the fallen have been so few. While corps, and divisions,
and brigades, and regiments have formed, and fought and
dwindled, and gone out of existence, a great majority of the
men who composed them are still living. The same is true
of the naval service. The election returns prove this. So
many votes could not else be found. The States regularly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">347</a></span>
holding elections, both now and four years ago, to wit
California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa,
Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan,
Minnesota, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New
York, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont,
West Virginia, and Wisconsin, cast 3,982,011 votes now
against 3,870,222 then, to which are to be added 33,762
cast now in the new States of Kansas and Nevada, which
States did not vote in 1860; thus swelling the aggregate to
4,075,773, and the net increase during the three years and a
half of war to 145,751.</p>

<p>&#8220;To this, again, should be added the number of all soldiers
in the field from Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New Jersey,
Delaware, Indiana, Illinois, and California, who, by the laws
of those States, could not vote away from their homes, and
which number cannot be less than ninety thousand. Nor yet
is this all. The number in organized territories is triple now
what it was four years ago, while thousands, white and black,
join us as the National army forces back the insurgent lines.
So much is shown, affirmatively and negatively, by the
election.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not natural to inquire how the increase has been
produced, or to show that it would have been greater but for
the war, which is partially true; the important fact remaining
demonstrated, that we have more men now than we had when
the war began; that we are not exhausted, nor in process of
exhaustion; that we are gaining strength, and may, if need
be, maintain the contest indefinitely. This as to men.</p>

<p>&#8220;National resources are now more complete and abundant
than ever; the National resources, then, are unexhausted, and,
as we believe, inexhaustible. The public purpose to reëstablish
and maintain the National authority is unchanged, and,
as we believe, unchangeable. The manner of continuing the
effort remains to choose. On careful consideration of all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">348</a></span>
evidence accessible, it seems to me that no attempts at negotiation
with the insurgent leader could result in any good.</p>

<p>&#8220;He would accept of nothing short of the severance of the
Union. His declarations to this effect are explicit and oft-repeated.
He does not attempt to deceive us. He affords
us no excuse to deceive ourselves. We cannot voluntarily
yield it. Between him and us the issue is distinct, simple,
and inflexible. It is an issue which can only be tried by war,
and decided by victory.</p>

<p>&#8220;If we yield, we are beaten; if the Southern people fail
him, he is beaten&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;either way, it would be the victory and
defeat following war. What is true, however, of him who
heads the insurgent cause, is not necessarily true of those who
follow. Although he cannot reaccept the Union, they can.
Some of them, we know, already desire peace and reunion.
The number of such may increase.</p>

<p>&#8220;They can at any moment have peace simply by laying
down their arms and submitting to the National authority
under the Constitution. After so much, the Government
could not, if it would, maintain war against them. The loyal
people would not sustain, or allow it. If questions should
remain, we would adjust them by the peaceful means of legislation,
conference, courts, and votes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Operating only in constitutional and lawful channels, some
certain and other possible questions are and would be beyond
the Executive power to adjust; for instance, the admission
of members into Congress, and whatever might require
the appropriation of money.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Executive power itself would be really diminished by
the cessation of actual war. Pardons and remissions of forfeiture,
however, would still be within Executive control. In
what spirit and temper this control would be exercised, can
be fairly judged of by the past. A year ago general pardon
and amnesty upon specified terms were offered to all except
certain designated classes, and it was at this same time made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">349</a></span>
known that the excepted classes were still within contemplation
of special clemency.</p>

<p>&#8220;During the year many availed themselves of the general
provision, and many more would, only that the sign of bad
faith in some led to such precautionary measures as rendered
the practical power less easy and certain. During the same
time, also, special pardons have been granted to individuals
of excepted classes, and no voluntary individual application
has been denied.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thus, practically, the door has been for a full year open
to all, except such as were not in condition to make free
choice; that is, such as were in custody or under constraint.
It is still so open to all; but the time may come, probably
will come, when public duty shall demand that it be closed,
and that, in lieu, more vigorous measures than heretofore
shall be adopted.</p>

<p>&#8220;In presenting the abandonment of armed resistance to
the National authority, on the part of the insurgents, as the
only indispensable condition to ending the war on the part
of the Government, I retract nothing heretofore said as to
slavery. I repeat the declaration made a year ago, that
while I remain in my present position I shall not attempt to
retract or modify the Emancipation Proclamation, nor shall I
return to slavery any person who is free by the terms of that
proclamation or by any of the acts of Congress.</p>

<p>&#8220;If the people should, by whatever mode, or means, make
it an Executive duty to re-enslave such persons, another, and
not I, must be their instrument to perform it.</p>

<p>&#8220;In stating a single condition of peace, I mean simply to
say that the war will cease on the part of the Government
whenever it shall have ceased on the part of those who
began it.</p>

<p>As illustrative of the genial, pleasant manner of the President,
take the following, in response to a serenade, December
6th, 1864:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Friends and Fellow-citizens</span>:&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;I believe I shall never
be old enough to speak without embarrassment when I have
nothing to talk about. I have no good news to tell you,
and yet I have no bad news to tell. We have talked of elections
until there is nothing more to say about them. The
most interesting news we now have is from Sherman. We
all know where he went in at, but I can&#8217;t tell where he will
come out at. I will now close by proposing three cheers for
General Sherman and his army.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>On the 24th of January, 1865, having been made the recipient
of a beautiful vase of skeleton leaves, gathered from the
battle-field of Gettysburg, which had been subscribed for at
the great Sanitary Fair, held in Philadelphia during the previous
summer, in reply to the warmly sympathetic and appreciative
address of the Chairman of the Committee entrusted
with the presentation, he said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Reverend Sir, and Ladies and Gentlemen</span>:&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;I accept,
with emotions of profoundest gratitude, the beautiful gift you
have been pleased to present to me. You will, of course,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">351</a></span>
expect that I acknowledge it. So much has been said about
Gettysburg and so well said, that for me to attempt to say
more may perhaps, only serve to weaken the force of that
which has already been said.</p>

<p>&#8220;A most graceful and eloquent tribute was paid to the
patriotism and self-denying labors of the American ladies, on
the occasion of the consecration of the National Cemetery at
Gettysburg, by our illustrious friend, Edward Everett, now,
alas! departed from earth. His life was a truly great one,
and, I think, the greatest part of it was that which crowned
its closing years.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish you to read, if you have not already done so, the
glowing, and eloquent, and truthful words which he then
spoke of the women of America. Truly the services they
have rendered to the defenders of our country in this perilous
time, and are yet rendering, can never be estimated as they
ought to be.</p>

<p>&#8220;For your kind wishes to me, personally, I beg leave to
render you, likewise, my sincerest thanks. I assure you they
are reciprocated. And now, gentlemen and ladies, may God

<p>With the opening of the new year, the air&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;as often before&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;was
filled with rumors that the insurgents were anxious to
negotiate for peace.</p>

<p>Some there were, even among Mr. Lincoln&#8217;s friends and
supporters, who were apprehensive that his &#8220;To whom it may
concern&#8221; announcement of the previous year, was somewhat
too curt and blunt. Without claiming to have as good an
opportunity as the President for judging in the premises, they
could not yet divest themselves of the idea that something
definite and tangible might result from an interview with representatives
from rebeldom; if nothing more, at least a distinct
understanding that no peace could be attained, without
separation, unless it were conquered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">352</a></span>
Thoroughly familiar with the designs and purposes of the
leading rebels as Mr. Lincoln was, and well aware that any
such attempt must prove futile, he was nevertheless determined
that no valid ground for censure should be afforded by
himself, in case a favorable opening presented itself.</p>

<p>Accordingly, when he learned&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;as he did during the last
week of January, from his friend, Francis P. Blair, who had
visited Richmond, with the President&#8217;s permission&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;that the
managers there were desirous of sending certain persons as
commissioners to learn from the United States Government
upon what terms an adjustment of difficulties could be made,
and that A.&nbsp;H. Stephens, of Georgia, R.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;T. Hunter, of
Virginia, and J.&nbsp;A. Campbell, of Alabama, had been sent
through the enemy&#8217;s lines by Davis for the purpose of a conference
upon the subject, Mr. Lincoln, not choosing that the
commissioners should visit Washington, entrusted the matter
to Secretary Seward, furnishing him with the following letter
of instructions, dated Executive Mansion, Washington, January
31st, 1865:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Hon. William H. Seward</span>, Secretary of State:&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;You will
proceed to Fortress Monroe, Virginia, there to meet and
informally confer with Messrs. Stephens, Hunter, and Campbell,
on the basis of my letter to F.&nbsp;P. Blair, Esq., of January
18, 1865, a copy of which you have.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will make known to them that three things are
indispensable, to wit:</p>

<p>&#8220;1. The restoration of national authority throughout all
the States.</p>

<p>&#8220;2. No receding by the Executive of the United States,
on the slavery question, from the position assumed thereon
in the late annual message to Congress, and in preceding
documents.</p>

<p>&#8220;3. No cessation of hostilities short of an end of the war
and the disbanding of all forces hostile to the Government.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">353</a></span>
&#8220;You will inform them that all propositions of theirs not
inconsistent with the above, will be considered and passed
upon in a spirit of sincere liberality.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will hear all they may choose to say, and report it to
me.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will not assume to definitely consummate any thing.</p>

<p class="in4">
&#8220;Yours truly,      <span class="right"><span class="smcap">A. Lincoln</span>.&#8221;</span><br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>On the 2d of February, the President himself left for
the point designated, and on the morning of the 3d, attended
by Mr. Seward, received Messrs. Stephens, Hunter, and
Campbell, on board a United States steamer anchored in
Hampton Roads.</p>

<p>The conference that ensued was altogether informal.
There was no attendance of Secretaries, clerks, or witnesses.
Nothing was written or read. The conversation, although
earnest and free, was calm and courteous and kind, on both
sides. The Richmond party approached the discussion
rather indirectly, and at no time did they make categorical
demands or tender formal stipulations or absolute refusals;
nevertheless, during the conference, which lasted four hours,
the several points at issue between the Government and
the insurgents were distinctly raised and discussed fully,
intelligently, and in an amicable spirit. What the insurgent
party seemed chiefly to favor was a postponement of the
question of separation, upon which the war was waged, and
a mutual direction of the efforts of the Government as well
as those of the insurgents, to some extraneous policy or
scheme for a season, during which passions might be expected
to subside, and the armies be reduced, and trade and intercourse
between the people of both sections be resumed.</p>

<p>It was suggested by them that through such postponement
we might have immediate peace, with some, not very certain,
prospect of an ultimate satisfactory adjustment of political
relations between the Government and the States, section or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">354</a></span>
people engaged in conflict with it. The suggestion, though
deliberately considered, was nevertheless regarded by the
President as one of armistice or truce, and he announced that
we could agree to no cessation or suspension of hostilities
except on the basis of the disbandonment of the insurgent
forces, and the restoration of the national authority throughout
all the States in the Union collaterally, and in subordination
to the proposition which was thus announced.</p>

<p>The anti-slavery policy of the United States was reviewed
in all its bearings, and the President announced that he must
not be expected to depart from the positions he had heretofore
assumed in his proclamation of emancipation and other documents,
as these positions were reiterated in his annual
message.</p>

<p>It was further declared by the President that the complete
restoration of the national authority everywhere was an indispensable
condition of any assent on our part to whatever form
of peace might be proposed. The President assured the
other party that while he must adhere to these positions he
would be prepared, so far as power was lodged with the
Executive, to exercise liberality. Its power, however, is
limited by the Constitution, and when peace should be made
Congress must necessarily act in regard to appropriations of
money and to the admission of representatives from the insurrectionary
States.</p>

<p>The Richmond party were then informed that Congress had,
on the 31st of January, adopted, by a constitutional majority,
a joint resolution submitting to the several States the proposition
to abolish slavery throughout the Union, and that
there was every reason to expect that it would soon be accepted
by three-fourths of the States, so as to become a part
of the national organic law.</p>

<p>The conference came to an end by mutual acquiescence,
without producing an agreement of views upon the several
matters discussed, or any of them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">355</a></span>
On the following morning the President and Secretary returned
to Washington, and shortly afterward, in compliance
with a resolution to that effect, Congress was informed in
detail of all that had led to the interview and its issue.</p>

<p>Thus was spiked the last gun bearing upon the terms on
which the rebels would consent to peace. Whatever might
have been the impression previously it was then well understood
that to the armies in the field then converging toward
Richmond, and not to the Executive of the nation, resort was
to be had for peace upon any basis which loyal men would
indorse.</p>

<p>On the 17th of February, in accordance with the general
custom at the expiration of a Presidential term, the Senate
was convened in active session by the following proclamation:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Whereas</span>, objects of interest to the United States require
that the Senate should be convened at twelve o&#8217;clock on the
fourth of March next, to receive and act upon such communications
as may be made to it on the part of the <span class="locked">Executive&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Now, therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the
United States, have considered it to be my duty to issue this
my proclamation, declaring that an extraordinary occasion
requires the Senate of the United States to convene for the
transaction of business, at the Capitol, in the city of Washington,
on the fourth day of March next, at twelve o&#8217;clock at
noon on that day, of which all who shall at that time be
entitled to act as members of that body are hereby required
to take notice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Given under my hand and the seal of the United States,
at Washington, the 17th day of February, in the year of our
Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-five, and of the
Independence of the United States of America, the eighty-ninth.</p>

<p>
&#8220;By the President:      <span class="right"><span class="smcap">Abraham Lincoln</span>.</span><br />

&#8220;<span class="smcap">William. H. Seward</span>, Secretary of State.&#8221;<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">356</a></span>
At this time, the military situation was very interesting to
every friend of the Union, whatever might have been the
feelings it created among those who had so long been in arms
against the Government.</p>

<p>Sherman had &#8220;come out&#8221; at Savannah, capturing it and
presenting it as a Christmas gift to the nation, after an extraordinary
march from Atlanta&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;which he had deprived of
all power for harm&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;directly through the heart of Georgia;
a march as to which the rebel journalists made ludicrous
efforts to be oracular in advance, predicting all manner of
mishaps from the Georgia militia and the various &#8220;lions&#8221; in
his way.</p>

<p>Thomas had fallen back leisurely to Nashville, forcing
Hood, his antagonist, who had supplanted Johnston on account
of his fighting qualities, to the loss of almost his entire
army in a sanguinary battle which occurred near that city,
Thomas being the attacking party. With the remnants of
his discomfited force, the fighting general had fallen back,
where was not definitely known, but evidently to some secure
support.</p>

<p>Sherman having recuperated his army, had left Savannah
and marched into South Carolina, where, according to the
beforenamed veracious chroniclers, he was to flounder in
bogs and quagmires, at the mercy of his valorous foes. He
floundered on, truly&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;floundered, so as to flank Charleston,
that nursery and hot-bed of treason, which had so long insulted
the land&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;and compel its hurried evacuation; floundered,
so as to capture and occupy Columbia, the capital of
the Palmetto State; floundered, so as to threaten Raleigh,
the capital of North Carolina; and at the time of which we
write, had at last floundered to Goldsborough, where he had
effected a connection with another column, which had pierced
to that point after the capture of Wilmington, North Carolina,
the pet port of disinterested blockade-runners&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;a capture
rendered certain by the storming of Fort Fisher, commanding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">357</a></span>
the entrance to its harbor, in connection with which one
Major-General was made and another unmade&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;whether the
latter result was brought about with or without the coöperation
of the commander of the naval part of the expedition, it
boots not here to inquire.</p>

<p>Whither Sherman would flounder next became to all
rebeldom a question of the very deepest interest. Davis
having been compelled by his Congress to assign the discarded
Johnston to a command, and Lee to the command of all the
rebel armies, Johnston was dispatched to head Sherman off,
should he be insane enough to attempt to move any nearer
Richmond&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;a species of insanity to which, it must be confessed,
he had shown a marked tendency.</p>

<p>Sheridan, too, having chased Early up and out of the
Shenandoah Valley&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;that Early the one of whom his troops
were wont to remark, that his principal business seemed to
be &#8220;to trade Confederate cannon for Yankee whiskey&#8221;&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;had
been raiding around Richmond in whatsoever direction he
listed, severing communications, gobbling up supplies, and
creating a general consternation.</p>

<p>And still the bull-dog&#8217;s teeth were firmly fastened in his
victim. Not twistings, nor squirmings, nor strugglings, nor
counterbites could do more than to defer&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;and that but for a
short time&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;the inevitable.</p>

<p>The rebel congress, at the very last moment of its last
session, had squeezed through a bill for arming the slaves,
and Davis had grimly wished them a safe and pleasant
journey to their respective homes. It was too late, both for
the slaves and the homes.</p>

<p>Meantime, on Saturday, March 4th&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;a day which opened
unpropitiously, so far as the elements were concerned, but
which redeemed itself before noontide, becoming bright and
cheerful&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;at the hour appointed, the oath of office was for the
second time administered to Mr. Lincoln&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;not, however, by
the same Chief Justice, for Roger B. Taney slept with his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">358</a></span>
fathers, and in his place stood Salmon P. Chase&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;after
which, on a staging erected at the eastern portico of the
Capitol, he read in a clear, distinct voice, his second inaugural,
occupying not more than ten minutes in the act:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Fellow-countrymen</span>:&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;At this second appearing to take
the oath of the Presidential office, there is less occasion for
an extended address than there was at the first. Then a
statement somewhat in detail of a course to be pursued
seemed very fitting and proper. Now, at the expiration of
four years, during which public declarations have constantly
been called forth on every point and phase of the great contest
which still absorbs the attention and engrosses the
energies of the nation, little that is new could be presented.</p>

<p>&#8220;The progress of our arms, upon which all else chiefly
depends, is as well known to the public as to myself, and it
is, I trust, reasonably satisfactory and encouraging to all.
With high hope for the future, no prediction in regard to it
is ventured. On the occasion corresponding to this four
years ago, all thoughts were anxiously directed to an impending
civil war. All dreaded it, all sought to avoid it.
While the inaugural address was being delivered from this
place, devoted altogether to saving the Union without war,
insurgent agents were in the city seeking to destroy it, without
war; seeking to dissolve the Union and divide the effects
by negotiation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Both parties deprecated war, but one of them would
make war rather than let the nation survive, and the other
would accept war rather than let it perish, and the war came.</p>

<p>&#8220;One-eighth of the whole population were colored slaves,
not distributed generally over the Union, but located in the
southern part of it. These slaves constituted a peculiar and
powerful interest. All knew that this interest was somehow
the cause of the war. To strengthen, perpetuate and extend
this interest was the object for which the insurgents would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">359</a></span>
rend the Union by war, while the Government claimed no
right to do more than to restrict the territorial enlargement
of it. Neither party expected the magnitude or the duration
which it has already attained. Neither anticipated that the
cause of the conflict might cease, even before the conflict
itself should cease. Each looked for an easier triumph and a
result less fundamental and astounding. Both read the same
Bible and pray to the same God, and each invokes his aid
against the other. It may seem strange that any man should
dare to ask a just God&#8217;s assistance in wringing his bread from
the sweat of other men&#8217;s faces. But let us judge not, that
we be not judged.</p>

<p>&#8220;The prayer of both should not be answered. That of
neither has been answered fully. The Almighty has his
own purposes. &#8216;Woe unto the world because of offences, for
it must needs be that offences come, but woe to that man by
whom the offence cometh.&#8217; If we shall suppose that American
slavery is one of these offences which, in the providence
of God, must needs come, but which, having continued
through his appointed time, he now wills to remove, and
that he gives to both North and South this terrible war as
the woe due to those by whom the offence came, shall we
discern therein any departure from those Divine attributes
which the believers in a living God always ascribe to him?</p>

<p>&#8220;Fondly do we hope, fervently do we pray that this
mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away. Yet, if
God wills that it continue until all the wealth piled by the
bondman&#8217;s two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil
shall be sunk and until every drop of blood drawn by the
lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword, as was
said three thousand years ago, so still it must be said, that
the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether.</p>

<p>&#8220;With malice towards none, with charity for all, with
firmness in the right, as God gives us to see the right, let us
strive on to finish the work we are in, to bind up the nation&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">360</a></span>
wounds, to care for him who shall have borne the battle, and
for his widow and his orphans, to do all which may achieve
and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and
with all nations.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Of this address&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;which was of course made the subject for
the coarsest comments of those who enjoyed nought so much
as aiding the pack that hounded Mr. Lincoln while living&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;an
English journal, second to none in ability and judgment,
and leader of the better class of thinkers in that country,
thus spoke:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;It is the most remarkable thing of the sort, ever pronounced
by any President of the United States from the first
day until now. Its Alpha and its Omega is <i>Almighty God</i>,
the God of justice and the Father of mercies, who is working
out the purposes of his love. It is invested with a dignity
and pathos, which lift it high above every thing of the kind,
whether in the Old World or the New. The whole thing
puts us in mind of the best men of the English Commonwealth;
there is, in fact, much of the old prophet about it.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>On the 16th of March, in accordance with an Act of Congress,
grace was extended to deserters by the following proclamation:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Whereas</span>, The twenty-first section of the act of Congress,
approved on the 3d instant, entitled &#8216;an act to amend the
several acts heretofore passed to provide for the enrolling and
calling out of the National forces, and for other purposes,&#8217; requires
that, in addition to the other lawful penalties of the
crime of desertion from the military or naval service, &#8216;all
persons who have deserted the military or naval service of
the United States, who shall not return to the said service
or report themselves to a provost-marshal within sixty days
after the proclamation hereinafter mentioned, shall be deemed
and taken to have voluntarily relinquished and forfeited their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">361</a></span>
rights to become citizens; and such deserters shall be forever
incapable of holding any office of trust or profit under the
United States, or of exercising any rights of citizens thereof;
and all persons who shall hereafter desert the military or
naval service, and all persons who, being duly enrolled, shall
depart the jurisdiction of the district in which he is enrolled,
or go beyond the limits of the United States, with the intent
to avoid any draft into the military or naval service duly ordered,
shall be liable to the penalties of this section. And
the President is hereby authorized and required forthwith, on
the passage of this act, to issue his proclamation setting forth
the provisions of this section, in which proclamation the
President is requested to notify all deserters returning within
sixty days, as aforesaid, that they shall be pardoned on condition
of returning to their regiments and companies, or to
such other organizations as they may be assigned to, unless
they shall have served for a period of time, equal to their
original term of enlistment&#8217;&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the
United States, do issue this my proclamation, as required by
said act, ordering and requiring all deserters to return to
their proper posts, and I do hereby notify them that all
deserters who shall within sixty days from the date of this
proclamation, viz.: on or before the tenth day of May, 1865,
return to service, or report themselves to a provost-marshal,
shall be pardoned, on condition that they return to their regiments
and companies or such other organizations as they may
be assigned to, and serve the remainder of their original terms
of enlistment, and, in addition thereto, a period equal to the
time lost by desertion.</p>

<p>&#8220;In testimony whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and
caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Done at the city of Washington, this eleventh day of

<p>On the afternoon of the 23d of March, 1865, the President,
accompanied by Mrs. Lincoln, his youngest son, and a few invited
guests, left Washington for an excursion to City Point.
The trip was taken under advice of his medical attendant, his
health having become somewhat impaired by his unremitting
attention to the pressing duties of his office.</p>

<p>A desperate attempt had been made by Lee to break
through the lines surrounding him. Assaulting our right
centre, he had been repulsed with a severe loss.</p>

<p>Shortly after, Grant determined that the moment had
arrived for his advance. A movement was ordered along
the entire line&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;Petersburg fell&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;Richmond was abandoned
in hot haste&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;and Lee&#8217;s routed army &#8220;driven to the wall.&#8221;</p>

<p>During the progress of the movement, the President forwarded,
from time to time, the particulars&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;pressed on to
the evacuated Capital&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;entered it, conspicuous amid the
sweeping mass of men, women, and children, black, white,
and yellow, running, shouting, dancing, swinging their caps,
bonnets, and handkerchiefs&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;passed on to the deserted mansion
of the rebel chief, cheer upon cheer going up from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">363</a></span>
excited multitude&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;there held a levee&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;left the same evening
for City Point&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;and soon afterward returned to Washington.</p>

<p>Lee, hemmed in on every side, soon after surrendered; the
terms of capitulation, which were dictated by the magnanimous
President, and dated Appomattox Court House, April ninth,
1865, being as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">General Robert E. Lee, Army C. S.</span>:&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;In accordance
with the substance of my letter to you of the 8th inst., I propose
to receive the surrender of the army of Northern Virginia
on the following terms, to wit: Rolls of all the officers
and men to be made in duplicate, one copy to be given to an
officer designated by me, the other to be retained by such
officer or officers as you may designate, the officers to give
their individual paroles not to take up arms against the
Government of the United States until properly exchanged,
and each company or regimental commander to sign a like
parole for the men of their commands. The arms, artillery,
and public property to be parked and stacked, and turned
over to the officers appointed by me to receive them. This
will not embrace the side arms of the officers, nor their private
horses or baggage. This done, each officer and man will be
allowed to return to their homes, not to be disturbed by
United States authority so long as they observe their parole
and the laws in force where they may reside.</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="l4">&#8220;Very respectfully,</span><br />
&#8220;<span class="smcap">U.&nbsp;S. Grant</span>, Lieutenant-General.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>

<p>Johnston was next in order; and toward him Sherman was
in motion.</p>

<p>The night following the President&#8217;s arrival in Washington,
the workmen of the Navy-yard formed in procession, marched
to the White House, in front of which thousands were assembled,
bands playing, and the entire throng alive with excitement.</p>

<p>Repeated calls having been made for him, he appeared at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">364</a></span>
the window, on the entrance door, calm amid the tumult, and
was greeted with cheers and waving of hats.</p>

<p>Comparative silence having been secured, he said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">My Friends</span>:&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;I am very greatly rejoiced that an occasion
has occurred so pleasurable that the people can&#8217;t restrain
themselves. I suppose that arrangements are being made
for some sort of formal demonstration&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;perhaps this evening
or to-morrow night. If there should be such a demonstration,
I, of course, will have to respond to it; and I will have
nothing to say if you dribble it out of me.</p>

<p>&#8220;I see you have a band. I propose now closing up by
requesting you to play a certain piece of music, or a tune&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;I
thought &#8216;Dixie&#8217; one of the best tunes I ever heard.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had heard that our adversaries over the way had attempted
to appropriate it. I insisted yesterday we had
fairly captured it! I presented the question to the Attorney
General, and he gave it as his opinion that it is our lawful
prize. I ask the band to give us a good turn upon it.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>The band accordingly played &#8220;Dixie,&#8221; with extraordinary
vigor, when &#8220;three cheers and a tiger&#8221; were given, followed
by the tune of &#8220;Yankee Doodle.&#8221; The President then proposed
three rousing cheers for Grant and all under his command&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;and
next, three cheers for the Navy and all its forces.</p>

<p>The President then retired, amid cheers, the tune of &#8220;Hail
Columbia,&#8221; and the firing of cannon.</p>

<p>On the night of the eleventh of April, the Executive Departments,
including the President&#8217;s House, as also many places
of business and private residences, were illuminated, and
adorned with transparencies and national flags; bon-fires
blazed in various parts of the city; and rockets were fired.</p>

<p>In response to the unanimous call of the thousands of
both sexes who surrounded the Executive Mansion, Mr. Lincoln
appeared at an upper window, and when the cheering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">365</a></span>
with which he was greeted had subsided, spoke as follows
in his last public speech:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Fellow-Citizens</span>:&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;We meet this evening, not in sorrow,
but in gladness of heart. The evacuation of Petersburg and
Richmond, and the surrender of the principal insurgent
army, give hope of a righteous and speedy peace, whose joyous
expression cannot be restrained.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the midst of this, however, He, from whom all blessings
flow, must not be forgotten. A call for a National
Thanksgiving is being prepared, and will be duly promulgated.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor must those, whose harder part gives us the cause of
rejoicing, be overlooked&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;and their honors must not be parcelled
out. With others I myself was near the front, and
had the high pleasure of transmitting much of the good news
to you, but no part of the honor, or praise, or execution, is
mine. To General Grant, his skilful officers and brave men,
all belongs. The gallant Navy stood ready, but was not in
reach to take an active part. By these recent successes the
reinauguration of the national authority, and the reconstruction,
which has had a large share of thought from the first,
is pressed much more closely upon our attention.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is fraught with great difficulty. Unlike the case of a
war between independent nations, there is no authorized
organ for us to treat with. No one man has authority to
give up the rebellion for any other man. We simply must
begin with and mould from disorganized and discordant elements.
Nor is it a small additional embarrassment, that we
the loyal people, differ amongst ourselves as to the mode,
manner, and measure of reconstruction.</p>

<p>&#8220;As a general rule, I abstain from reading the reports of
attacks upon myself, wishing not to be provoked by that to
which I cannot properly offer an answer; for, spite of this
precaution, however, it comes to my knowledge that I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">366</a></span>
much censured from some supposed agency in setting up and
seeking to sustain the new State Government of Louisiana.
In this I have done just so much and no more than the public
knows. In the annual Message of December, 1863, and
the accompanying Proclamation, I presented a plan of reconstruction,
as the phrase goes, which I promised, if adopted
by any State, should be acceptable to and sustained by the
Executive Government of the nation.</p>

<p>&#8220;I distinctly stated that this was not the only plan which
might possibly be acceptable; and I also distinctly protested
that the Executive claimed no right to say when or whether
members should be admitted to seats in Congress from such
States. This plan was in advance submitted to the then
Cabinet, and as distinctly approved by every member of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;One of them suggested that I should then, and in that connection,
apply the Emancipation Proclamation to the theretofore
excepted parts of Virginia and Louisiana; that I should
drop the suggestion about apprenticeship for freed people;
and that I should omit the protest against my own power in
regard to the admission of members of Congress; but even he
approved every part and parcel of the plan which has since
been employed or touched by the action of Louisiana. The
new Constitution of Louisiana, declaring emancipation for the
whole State, particularly applies the proclamation to the part
previously excepted. It does not adopt apprenticeship for
freed people, and it is silent&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;as it could not well be otherwise&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;about
the admission of members to Congress; so that,
as it applies to Louisiana, every member of the Cabinet fully
approved the plan.</p>

<p>&#8220;The message went to Congress, and I received many
commendations of the plan, written and verbal, and not a
single objection to it by any professed emancipationist came
to my knowledge until after the news reached Washington
that the people of Louisiana had begun to move in accordance
with it. From about July, 1862, I had corresponded with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">367</a></span>
different persons supposed to be interested in seeking a reconstruction
of a State Government for Louisiana. When the
message of 1863, with the plan before mentioned, reached
New Orleans, and General Banks wrote me that he was confident
the people, with his military coöperation, would reconstruct
substantially on that plan, I wrote him and some of
them to try it. They tried it, and the result is known.</p>

<p>&#8220;Such only has been my agency in getting up the Louisiana
Government. As to sustaining it, my promise is out, as
before stated; but, as bad promises are better broken than
kept, I shall treat this as a bad promise, and break it whenever
I shall be convinced that keeping it is adverse to the
public interest. But I have not yet been so convinced.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been shown a letter on this subject, supposed to
be an able one, in which the writer expresses regret that my
mind has not seemed to be definitely fixed on the question
whether the seceded States, so called, are in the Union or out
of it. It would, perhaps, add astonishment to his regret
were he to learn that since I have found professed Union men
endeavoring to make that a question, I have purposely forborne
any public expression upon it, as it appears to me that
question has not been, nor yet is, a practically material one,
and that any discussion of it while it thus remains practically
material could have no effect other than the mischievous one
of dividing our friends.</p>

<p>&#8220;As yet, whatever it may become hereafter, that question
is bad, as the basis of a controversy, and good for nothing at
all, a merely pernicious abstraction. We all agree that the
seceded States, so-called, are out of their proper practical
relation with the Union, and that the sole object of the Government,
civil and military, in regard to those States, is to
again get them into that proper practical relation. I believe
it is not only possible, but in fact easier to do this without
deciding or even considering whether these States have ever
been out of the Union, than with it; finding themselves safely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">368</a></span>
at home, it would be utterly immaterial whether they had
ever been abroad.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us all join in doing the acts necessary to restoring the
proper practical relations between these States and the Union,
and each forever after, innocently indulge his own opinion
whether in doing the acts he brought the States from without
into the Union, or only gave them proper assistance, they
never having been out of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;The amount of constituency, so to speak, on which the
new Louisiana Government rests, would be more satisfactory
to all if it contained 50,000, 30,000, or even 20,000, instead
of only about 12,000, as it does.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is also unsatisfactory to some that the elective franchise
is not given to the colored men. I would myself prefer that
it were conferred on the very intelligent, and on those who
serve our cause as soldiers. Still the question is not whether
the Louisiana Government, as it stands, is quite all that is
desirable. The question is, will it be wiser to take it as it is,
and help to improve it, or to reject and disperse it? Can
Louisiana be brought into proper practical relation with the
Union sooner by sustaining or by discarding her new State
Government?</p>

<p>&#8220;Some twelve thousand voters in the heretofore slave State
of Louisiana have sworn allegiance to the Union, assumed to
be the rightful political power of the State, held elections,
organized a State government, adopted a free State constitution,
giving the benefit of public schools equally to black and
white, and empowering the Legislature to confer the elective
franchise upon the colored man. Their Legislature has
already voted to ratify the Constitutional amendment recently
passed by Congress, abolishing slavery throughout the
Nation. These twelve thousand persons are thus fully committed
to the Union, and to perpetual freedom in the State&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;committed
to the very beings and nearly all the things the
Nation wants&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;and they ask the Nation&#8217;s recognition and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">369</a></span>
its assistance to make good their committal. Now, if we
reject and spurn them, we do our utmost to disorganize and
disperse them. We, in fact, say to the white man, &#8216;You are
worthless, or worse; we will neither help you nor be helped
by you.&#8217; To the blacks we say, &#8216;This cup of liberty which
your old masters there hold to your lips we will dash from
you, and leave you to the chances of gathering the spilled
and scattered contents in some vague and undefined way
when, where, and how.&#8217; If this course, by discouraging and
paralyzing both white and black, has any tendency to bring
Louisiana into proper practical relations with the Union, I
have so far been unable to perceive it. If, on the contrary,
we recognize and sustain the new Government of Louisiana,
the converse of all this is made true.</p>

<p>&#8220;We encourage the hearts and nerve the arms of the
twelve thousand to adhere to their work, and argue for it, and
proselyte for it, and fight for it, and feed it, and grow it, and
ripen it, to a complete success. The colored man, too, in
seeing all united for him, is inspired with vigilance, and
energy, and daring to the same end. Grant that he desires
the elective franchise, will he not attain it sooner by saving
the already advanced steps toward it than by running backward
over them? Concede that the new Government of
Louisiana is only what it should be, as the egg is to the fowl,
we shall sooner have the fowl by hatching the egg, than by
smashing it. [Laughter.]</p>

<p>&#8220;Again, if we reject Louisiana, we also reject our vote in
favor of the proposed amendment to the National Constitution.
To meet this proposition, it has been argued that no
more than three-fourths of those States which have not attempted
secession are necessary to validly ratify the amendment.
I do not commit myself against this, further than to
say that such a ratification would be questionable, and sure
to be persistently questioned, while a ratification by three-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">370</a></span>fourths
of all the States would be unquestioned and unquestionable.</p>

<p>&#8220;I repeat the question. Can Louisiana be brought into
proper practical relation with the Union sooner by sustaining
or by discarding her new State Government? What has
been said of Louisiana will apply severally to other States;
yet so great peculiarities pertain to each State, and such important
and sudden changes occur in the same State, and
withal so new and unprecedented is the whole case, that no
exclusive and inflexible plan can safely be prescribed. As to
details and collaterals, such an exclusive and inflexible plan
would surely become a new entanglement. Important principles
may and must be inflexible.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the present situation, as the phrase goes, it may be
my duty to make some new announcement to the people of
the South. I am considering, and shall not fail to act when
satisfied that action will be proper.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>On the 11th of April, also, appeared the following proclamation:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Whereas</span>, By my proclamation of the 19th and 27th days
of April, 1861, the ports of the United States of Virginia,
North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama,
Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas were declared to be subject
to blockade, but whereas the said blockade has, in consequence
of actual military occupation by this Government,
since then been conditionally set aside or released in respect
to the ports of Norfolk and Alexandria, in the State of Virginia,
Beaufort, in the State of North Carolina, Port Royal,
in the State of South Carolina, Pensacola and Fernandina, in
the State of Florida, and New Orleans, in the State of Louisiana;
and whereas, by the 4th section of the act of Congress
approved on the 13th of July, 1861, entitled &#8216;an act further
to provide for the collection of duties on imports, and for other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">371</a></span>
purposes,&#8217; the President, for the reasons therein set forth, is
authorized to close certain ports of entry.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, therefore, be it known that I, <span class="smcap">Abraham Lincoln</span>,
President of the United States, do hereby proclaim that the
ports of Richmond, Tappahannock, Cherry Stone, Yorktown,
and Petersburg, in Virginia; of Camden, Elizabeth City,
Edenton, Plymouth, Washington, Newbern, Ocracoke, and
Wilmington, in North Carolina; of Charleston, Georgetown,
and Beaufort, in South Carolina; of Savannah, St. Marys,
Brunswick, and Darien, in Georgia; of Mobile, in Alabama;
of Pearl river, Shieldsboro&#8217;, Natchez, and Vicksburg, in Mississippi;
of St. Augustine, Key West, St. Marks, Port Leon,
St. Johns, Jacksonville, and Apalachicola, in Florida; of
Teche and Franklin, in Louisiana; of Galveston, La Salle,
Brazos de Santiago, Point Isabel, and Brownsville, in Texas,
are hereby closed, and all rights of importation, warehousing,
and other privileges shall, in respect to the ports aforesaid,
cease until they shall again have been opened by order of the
President; and if, while said ports are so closed, any ship or
vessel from beyond the United States, or having on board
any articles subject to duties, shall attempt to enter any such
port, the same, together with its tackle, apparel, furniture,
and cargo, shall be forfeited to the United States.</p>

<p>&#8220;In witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand and
caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Done at the City of Washington this eleventh day of April,
in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and
sixty-five, and of the Independence of the United States of
America the eighty-ninth.</p>

<p class="p0">&#8220;William H. Seward, Secretary of State.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>

<p>And on the same day the following:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">372</a></span></p><blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Whereas</span>, for some time past vessels-of-war of the United
States have been refused in certain foreign ports privileges
and immunities to which they were entitled by treaty, public
law, or the comity of nations, at the same time that vessels-of-war
of the country wherein the said privileges and immunities
have been withheld have enjoyed them fully and uninterruptedly
in ports of the United States, which condition of
things has not always been forcibly resisted by the United
States, although, on the other hand, they have not at any
time failed to protest against and declare their dissatisfaction
with the same. In the view of the United States no
condition any longer exists which can be claimed to justify
the denial to them by any one of said nations of customary
naval rights, such as has heretofore been so unnecessarily
persisted <span class="locked">in&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Now, therefore, I, <span class="smcap">Abraham Lincoln</span>, President of the
United States, do hereby make known that if after a
reasonable time shall have elapsed for intelligence of this
proclamation to have reached any foreign country in whose
ports the said privileges and immunities shall have been
refused as aforesaid, they shall continue to be so refused,
then and thenceforth the same privileges and immunities
shall be refused to the vessels-of-war of that country in the
ports of the United States; and this refusal shall continue
until war-vessels of the United States shall have been placed
upon an entire equality in the foreign ports aforesaid with
vessels of other countries. <i>The United States, whatever
claim or pretence may have existed heretofore, are now at
least entitled to claim and concede an entire and friendly
equality of rights and hospitalities with all maritime
nations.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;In witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand and

&#8220;<span class="smcap">William H. Seward</span>, Secretary of State.&#8221;<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>And, on the twelfth April, the following supplementary
proclamation:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Whereas</span>, By my proclamation of this date the port of
Key West, in the State of Florida, was inadvertently included
among those which are not open to commerce:</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, therefore, be it known that I, <span class="smcap">Abraham Lincoln</span>,
President of the United States, do hereby declare and make
known that the said port of Key West is and shall remain
open to foreign and domestic commerce, upon the same conditions
by which that commerce has hitherto been governed.</p>

caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.</p>

&#8220;<span class="smcap">Wm. H. Seward</span>, Secretary of State.&#8221;<br />

<p>The light in which the administration regarded the position
of affairs can best be judged from the following official
bulletin from the War Department, bearing date April thirteenth,
1865:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;This Department, after mature consideration and consultation
with the Lieutenant-General upon the results of the
recent campaigns, has come to the following determination,
which will be carried into effect by appropriate orders, to be
immediately issued:</p></blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<i>Second.</i> To curtail purchases for arms, ammunition,
quartermaster&#8217;s and commissary supplies, and reduce the
expenses of the military establishment and its several
branches.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Third.</i> To reduce the number of general and staff officers
to the actual necessities of the service.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Fourth.</i> To remove all military restrictions upon trade

<p>On the morning of Friday, April fourteenth, 1865, after an
interesting conversation with his eldest son, Robert, a captain
on General Grant&#8217;s staff, relative to the surrender of Lee,
with the details of which the son was familiar, the President,
hearing that Schuyler Colfax, Speaker of the House of Representatives,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">375</a></span>
was in the Executive Mansion, invited the latter
to a chat in the reception-room, and during the following
hour the talk turned upon his future policy toward the rebellion&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;a
matter which he was about to submit to his Cabinet.</p>

<p>After an interview with John P. Hale, then recently
appointed Minister to Spain, as well as with several Senators
and Representatives, a Cabinet meeting was held, at eleven
o&#8217;clock, General Grant being present, which proved to be one
of the most satisfactory and important consultations held
since his first inauguration. The future policy of the Administration
was harmoniously and unanimously agreed upon,
and upon the adjournment of the meeting the Secretary of
War remarked that the Government was then stronger than
at any period since the commencement of the rebellion.</p>

<p>It was afterwards remembered that at this meeting the
President turned to General Grant and asked him if he had
heard from General Sherman. General Grant replied that he
had not, but was in hourly expectation of receiving dispatches
from him, announcing the surrender of Johnston.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said the President, &#8220;you will hear very soon now
and the news will be important.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you think so?&#8221; said the General.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because,&#8221; said Mr. Lincoln, &#8220;I had a dream last night,
and ever since the war began I have invariably had the same
dream before any very important military event has occurred.&#8221;
He then instanced Bull Run, Antietam, Gettysburg, etc., and
said that before each of these events he had had the same
dream, and turning to Secretary Welles, said:</p>

<p>&#8220;It is in your line, too, Mr. Welles. The dream is that I
saw a ship sailing very rapidly, and I am sure that it portends
some important national event.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the afternoon, a long and pleasant conversation was held
with eminent citizens from Illinois.</p>

<p>In the evening, during a talk with Messrs. Colfax and
Ashman&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;the latter of whom presided at the Chicago Convention,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">376</a></span>
in 1860&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;speaking about his trip to Richmond, when
the suggestion was made that there was much uneasiness at
the North while he was at what had been the rebel capital,
for fear that some traitor might shoot him, Mr. Lincoln
reportively replied, that he would have been alarmed himself,
if any other person had been President and gone there, but
that, as for himself, he did not feel in any danger whatever.</p>

<p>This possibility of an assassination had been presented
before to the President&#8217;s mind, but it had not occasioned him
a moment&#8217;s uneasiness. A member of his Cabinet one day
said to him, &#8220;Mr. Lincoln, you are not sufficiently careful of
yourself. There are bad men in Washington. Did it never
occur to you that there are rebels among us who are bad
enough to attempt your life?&#8221; The President stepped to a
desk and drew from a pigeon-hole a package of letters.
&#8220;There,&#8221; said he, &#8220;every one of these contains a threat to
assassinate me. I might be nervous, if I were to dwell upon
the subject, but I have come to this conclusion: there are
opportunities to kill me every day of my life, if there are
persons disposed to do it. It is not possible to avoid
exposure to such a fate, and I shall not trouble myself
about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Upon the evening alluded to, while conversing upon a
matter of business with Mr. Ashman, he saw that the
latter was surprised at a remark which he had made, when,
prompted by his well-known desire to avoid any thing offensive,
he immediately said, &#8220;You did not understand me,
Ashman: I did not mean what you inferred, and I will take
it all back, and apologize for it.&#8221; He afterward gave Mr.
A. a card, admitting himself and friend for a further conversation
early in the morning.</p>

<p>Turning to Mr. Colfax, he said, &#8220;You are going with Mrs.
Lincoln and me to the theatre, I hope.&#8221; The President and
General Grant had previously accepted an invitation to be
present that evening at Ford&#8217;s Theatre, but the General had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">377</a></span>
been obliged to leave for the North. Mr. Lincoln did not
like to entirely disappoint the audience, as the announcement
had been publicly made, and had determined to fulfil his
acceptance.</p>

<p>Mr. Colfax, however, declining on account of other engagements,
Mr. Lincoln said to him, &#8220;Mr. Sumner has the gavel
of the Confederate Congress, which he got at Richmond to
hand to the Secretary of War. But I insisted then that he
must give it to you; and you tell him for me to hand it over.&#8221;
Mr. Ashman alluded to the gavel, still in his possession,
which he had used at Chicago; and about half an hour after
the time they had intended to leave for the theatre, the President
and Mrs. Lincoln rose to depart, the former reluctant
and speaking about remaining at home a half hour longer.</p>

<p>At the door he stopped and said, &#8220;Colfax, do not forget
to tell the people in the mining regions, as you pass through
them, what I told you this morning about the development
when peace comes, and I will telegraph you at San Francisco.&#8221;
Having shaken hands with both gentlemen and
bidden them a pleasant good-bye, the President with his
party left for the theatre.</p>

<p>The box occupied by them was on the second tier above
the stage, at the right of the audience, the entrance to it
being by a door from the adjoining gallery. One, who had
planned Mr. Lincoln&#8217;s assassination with extraordinary precautions
against any failure, having effected an entrance by
deceiving the guard, found himself in a dark corridor, of
which the wall made an acute angle with the door. The
assassin had previously gouged a channel from the plaster
and placed near by a stout piece of board, which he next
inserted between the wall and the panel of the door.</p>

<p>Ingress then being rendered impossible, he next turned
toward the entrances to the President&#8217;s box, two in number,
as the box by a sliding partition could, at pleasure, be converted
into two. The door at the bottom of the passage was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">378</a></span>
open; that nearer the assassin was closed. Both had spring-locks,
but their screws had been carefully loosened so as to
yield to a slight pressure, if necessary.</p>

<p>Resort was had to the hither door, in which a small hole
had been bored, for the purpose of securing a view of the
interior of the box, the door first described having first been
fastened, and the discovery made that the occupants had
taken seats as follows: the President in the arm-chair
nearest the audience, Mrs. Lincoln next, then, after a considerable
space, a Miss Clara Harris in the corner nearest
the stage, and a Major H.&nbsp;R. Rathbone on a lounge along
the further wall.</p>

<p>The play was, &#8220;Our American Cousin.&#8221; While all were
intent upon its representation, the report of a pistol first announced
the presence of the assassin, who uttered the word
&#8220;Freedom!&#8221; and advanced toward the front. The Major
having discerned the murderer through the smoke, and grappled
with him, the latter dropped his pistol and aimed with
a knife at the breast of his antagonist, who caught the blow
in the upper part of his left arm, but was unable to detain the
desperado, though he immediately seized him again. The
villain, however, leaped some twelve feet down upon the
open stage, tangling his spur in the draped flag below the
box and stumbling in his fall.</p>

<p>Recovering himself immediately, he flourished his dagger,
shouted &#8220;<i>Sic semper tyrannis</i>&#8221; and &#8220;<i>The South is avenged</i>,&#8221;
retreated successfully through the labyrinth of the theatre&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;perfectly
familiar to him&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;to his horse in waiting below.
Between the deed of blood and the escape there was not the
lapse of a minute. The hour was about half-past ten. There
was but one pursuer, and he from the audience, but he was
outstripped.</p>

<p>The meaning of the pistol-shot was soon ascertained.
Mr. Lincoln had been shot in the back of the head, behind
the left ear, the ball traversing an oblique line to the right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">379</a></span>
ear. He was rendered instantly unconscious, and never knew
friends or pain again. Having been conveyed as soon as
possible to a house opposite the theatre, he expired there the
next morning, April fifteenth, 1865, at twenty-two minutes
past seven o&#8217;clock, attended by the principal members of his
Cabinet and other friends, from all of whom the heart-rending
spectacle drew copious tears of sorrow. Mrs. Lincoln
and her son Robert were in an adjoining apartment&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;the
former bowed down with anguish, the latter strong
enough to sustain and console her. A disconsolate widow
and two sons now constituted the entire family. Soon after
nine o&#8217;clock, the body was removed to the White House
under military escort.</p>

<p>Thus ended the earthly career of Abraham Lincoln, sixteenth
President of the United States, on the threshold of
his fifty-seventh year and second Presidential term.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Sic semper tyrannis!</i>&#8221; And this the justification for the
murder of a ruler who had</p>

<div class="center-container"><div class="poem">
<span class="i0">&#8220;&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;&mdash; borne his faculties so meek, had been<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So clear in his great office, that his virtues<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will plead like angels, trumpet-tongued, against<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The deep damnation of his taking-off.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>&#8220;The South avenged!&#8221; And by the cold-blooded murder
of the best friend that repentant rebels ever had&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;of one who
had long withstood the pressing appeals of his warmest personal
and political friends for less lenity and more rigor in
dealing with traitors.</p>

<p>It was written in the decrees of the Immutable that he
should fall by the bullet&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;not, indeed, on the battle-field,
whose sad suggestings he had so often, and so tenderly,
lovingly heeded&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;but in the midst of his family, while seeking
relief from the cares of state&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;and by a murderer&#8217;s hand!&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;the
first President to meet such a fate&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;thenceforth our
martyr-chief!</p>

<p>But sorrow was tempered with mercy. He did not fall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">380</a></span>
until a benignant Providence had permitted him to enjoy a
foretaste, at least, of the blessings which he had been instrumental
in conferring upon the land he loved so well.</p>

<p>The pledges of his first Inaugural Address had been amply
redeemed&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;those pledges which so many declared impossible
of fulfilment, which not a few mocked as beyond human
power to accomplish. The power confided to him had been
successfully used &#8220;to hold, occupy, and possess the property
and places belonging to the Government.&#8221; No United States
fort at the time of his fall flaunted treason in the eyes of the
land. The day of his murder the old flag had been flung to
the breeze from Sumter with ceremonies befitting the joyous occasion,
by the very hands that four years before had been compelled
to lower it to arrogant traitors; and friends of freedom
for man, irrespective of color or race, walked the streets of
Charleston&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;a city of desolation, a skeleton of its former self&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;jubilant
that, since God so willed it, in His own good
time, Freedom was National and Slavery but a thing of the
past.</p>

<p>When he fell, the Nation, brought by the stern necessities
of direful war to the discharge of duties befitting a better manhood,
passing by all projects for an emancipation of slaves,
which should be merely gradual, not content even that such
emancipation had been proclaimed as a measure of military
necessity, had spoken in favor of such an amendment of the
Constitution as should forever prohibit any claim of property
in man. Though the final consummation of that great
measure had not been reached when our President was removed,
it was given him to feel assured that the end was not
distant, was even then close at hand.</p>

<p>When he fell, that body of traitors which had assumed to
be a Government had fled, one scarcely knew whither,
with whatever of ill-gotten gains their greedy hands could
grasp&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;their main army captive, the residue of their military
force on the point of surrendering. From what had been their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">381</a></span>
capital, in the mansion appropriated to the special use of
the chiefest among the conspirators, he had been permitted to
send words of greeting to the nation.</p>

<p>When he fell, treason throughout the land lay gasping,
dying.</p>

<p>It needed not that dismal, dreary, mid-April day to intensify
the sorrow. As on the wings of lightning the news
sped through the land&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;&#8220;the President is Shot&#8221;&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;&#8220;is
dying&#8221;&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;&#8220;is dead&#8221;&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;men knew scarcely how to credit the
tale. When the fearful certainty came home to each, strong
men bowed themselves and wept&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;maid and matron joined in
the plaint. With no extraneous prompting, with no impulse
save that of the heart alone, the common grief took on a common
garb. Houses were draped&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;the flag of our country
hung pensive at half-mast&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;portraitures of the loved dead
were found on all.</p>

<p>And dreary as was the day when first the tidings swept
through the country, patriot hearts were drearier still. It
was past analysis. It was as if chaos and dread night had
come again.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the honored dead lay in state in the country&#8217;s
capitol.</p>

<p>On that dreamy, hazy nineteenth of April&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;suggesting, were
it not for the early green leaves, the fresh springing grass, the
glad spring caroling of birds, &#8220;that sweet autumnal summer
which the Indian loved so well&#8221;&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;on that day when sleep
wooed one even in the early morn, his obsequies were celebrated
in the country&#8217;s metropolis.</p>

<p>And throughout the land, minute guns were fired, bells
tolled, business suspended, and the thoughtful betook themselves
to prayer, if so be that what verily seemed a curse
might pass from us.</p>

<p>Thence the funeral <i>cortege</i> moved to the final resting-place&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;the
remains of a darling son, earlier called, accompanying
those of the father&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;by the route the President had taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">382</a></span>
when first he had been summoned to the chair of State.
Before half of the mournful task was done, came tidings that
the assassin had been sent to his final account by the avenger&#8217;s
hand, gurgling out, as his worthless life ebbed away,
&#8220;useless! useless!&#8221;</p>

<p>As the sad procession wended its way, where hundreds had
gathered in &#8217;61, impelled by mere curiosity or by partisan
sympathy, thousands gathered, four years later, through
affection, through reverence, through deep, abiding sorrow.</p>

<p>Flowers beautified the lifeless remains&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;dirges were sung&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;the
people&#8217;s great heart broke out into sobs and sighing.</p>

<p>And so, home to the prairie they bore him whom, when
first he was called, the Nation knew not&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;whom, mid the
storms and ragings of those years of civil war, they had
learned, had loved, to call father and friend.</p>

<p>In the Oak Ridge Cemetery, in his own Springfield, on the
fourth of May, 1865, they laid him to rest, at the foot of a
knoll, in the most beautiful part of the ground, over which
forest trees&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;rare denizens of the prairie&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;look lovingly.</p>

<p>There all that is mortal of <span class="smcap">Abraham Lincoln</span> reposes.</p>

<p>&#8220;The immortal?&#8221; Hail, and farewell!</p>

<span class="subhead">THE MAN.</span></h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang">Reasons for His Re-election&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;What was Accomplished&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;Leaning on the People&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;State
Papers&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;His Tenacity of Purpose&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;Washington and Lincoln&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;As a Man&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;Favorite Poem&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;Autobiography&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;His
Modesty&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;A Christian&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;Conclusion.</p></blockquote>

<p>What shall be said, in summing up, of Abraham Lincoln
as a statesman and a man? That from such humble beginnings,
in circumstances so adverse, he rose to be the Chief
Magistrate of one of the leading countries of the world, would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">383</a></span>
were it in any other country, be evidence of ability of the
very highest order.</p>

<p>Here, however, so many from similar surroundings have
achieved similar results that this fact of itself does not necessarily
unfold the man clearly and fully to us. He might have
been put forward for that high station as a skillful and accomplished
politician, from whose elevation hosts of partisans
counted upon their own personal advancement and profit.
Or he might have been a successful general; or one possessing
merely negative qualities, with no salient points, all
objectionable angularities rounded off till that desirable availability,
which has at times been laid hold of for the Presidency
had been reached; or, yet again, one who had for a long time
been in the front ranks of an old and triumphant party, and,
therefore, as such matters have been managed with us, admitted
to have strong claims upon such party; or, lastly, one
who, having for many years schemed and plotted and labored,
in season and out of season, for the nomination, at last
achieved it.</p>

<p>For such Presidents have been furnished us. But he was
neither. And yet the highest point to which an American
may aspire he reached. Clearly, then, there must have been
something of strength and of worth in the man.</p>

<p>He was reëlected, the first President since Jackson to
whom that honor had been accorded. And thirty-two years
had passed&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;eight Presidential terms&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;since Jackson&#8217;s reëlection.
He was, moreover, reëlected by a largely increased
vote.</p>

<p>The years covered by his administration were the stormiest
in American history, &#8220;piled high,&#8221; as he himself said, &#8220;with
difficulties.&#8221; No President was ever more severely attacked,
more unsparingly denounced than he. None more belittled
than he. And yet he was triumphantly reëlected. Why?
For the same reason that first brought him before the country.</p>

<p>Primarily and mainly because the mass of the people had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">384</a></span>
unbounded confidence in his honesty and devotion to principle.
Though these qualities, it is pleasant to say, have been
by no means rare in our Presidents, yet Abraham Lincoln
seemed so to speak, so steeped and saturated in them that a
hold was thereby obtained upon the common mind, the like
of which no other President since Washington had secured.
The bitterest opponent of his policy was constrained, if
candid, to admit, if not the existence of these qualities, at
least the prevailing popular belief in their existence.</p>

<p>What shall be said of him as a statesman?</p>

<p>That he found the fabric of our National Government rocking
from turret to foundation stone&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;that he left it, after four
years of strife such as, happily, the world rarely witnesses,
firmly fixed, and sure; this should serve in some sort, as
an answer.</p>

<p>But might not this be owing, or principally so, to the
ability of the counsellors whom he gathered about him?
Beyond a doubt the meed of praise is to be shared. Yet we
should remember that few Presidents have so uniformly
acted of and for themselves in matters of state policy, as did
Mr. Lincoln. Upon many questions the opinions of his
Cabinet were sought&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;a Cabinet representing the various
shades of thought, the various stages of progress, through
which the people, of whom they were the exponents, were
passing from year to year&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;after obtaining which, he would
act. But, in most instances, perhaps, he struck out for himself,
after careful, conscientious reflection, launching his policy
upon unknown seas, quietly assured that truth was with
him and that he could not be mistaken. Nor was he often.</p>

<p>Having to feel his way along, for the most part&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;groping
in the dark&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;he could not push on so fast and far as to leave
the people out of breath or staring far in his rear. Still, it
must not be understood that he never acted against what was
plainly the popular will. The man was not of that mould.
Unquestionably in his dealings with the two leading European<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">385</a></span>
powers he often acted in direct opposition to the
popular wish. Nothing would have been easier than for him
to have brought a foreign war upon the country; and in such
action, for a time at least, he would have been sustained by
the mass of the people. So, too, as to vindictive measures
towards the rebels. By adopting these he would, oftentimes,
have been in harmony with the general wish for vengeance
and retaliation. In both these instances&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;to name no others&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;he
chose to act counter to the current sentiment. More
politic, with a more piercing outlook than the mass, he saw
the end from the beginning, and in the one case chose to
overlook what was, to his mind, grossly wrong, and in the
other, to stand up for the general interests of humanity
through all time rather than to cater to the desire of the
hour, natural and, perhaps, pardonable though it was.</p>

<p>What is meant is this&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;that, in the complications in which
the country was involved, he invariably acted, where expediency
simply and not principle was concerned, so as to feel
sure that the body of the people were with him. If failure
were to result, he would have them feel that the responsibility
for it rested as much upon them as upon him. He earnestly
endeavored to point out what he judged the better way and
to bring the people to his conviction; but, if they relucted, he
waited till they should have advanced where, or nearly where,
he was. This was generally felt, and it added largely to the
confidence reposed in him. By means of it, a general acquiescence
was procured in many measures earlier than could
have been gained by any other course. We Americans are a
peculiar people in some respects. We dislike to be led by
any man. Nay, we stoutly deny that we are. We are not&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;when
we see the leading strings.</p>

<p>Mr. Lincoln&#8217;s state papers in their structure and composition
were not always what a critical scholar would have
desired. Some would say they were presented quite too
often in undress. The people are not profound critics. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">386</a></span>
could comprehend every word. They felt that they were addressed
as fellow-citizens. The ordinarily formal and stilted
official documents came from his plain pen a talk to them by
the fireside. He said, moreover, exactly what he meant and
as he meant, in his own clear cogent way, void of verbiage,
homely often but always the outgrowth of a profound intelligent
conviction. And, generally, he struck home. His were
the words to which &#8220;the common pulse of man keeps time.&#8221;
How studded are his papers with lucid illustration; how
transparently honest and candid, like the man, their author!</p>

<p>His tenacity of purpose was marked. Signing that immortal
proclamation, which made him the Liberator of
America, on the afternoon of January 1st, 1863, after hours
of New Year&#8217;s hand-shaking, he said to friends that night&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;&#8220;The
signature looks a little tremulous, for my hand was
tired, but my resolution was firm. I told them in September,
if they did not return to their allegiance and cease murdering
our soldiers, I would strike at this pillar of their strength.
And now the promise shall be kept; and not one word of it
will I ever recall.&#8221; In all the varying scenes through which
as our leader he passed, avoiding the extremes of sudden
exultation or deep depression, calm and quiet, and resolute
and determined, he kept on his course, with duty as his
guiding star, an unwarped conscience his prompter. Feeling
always that he bore his life in his hands, in the perilous position
in which he was placed, as well as he who went forth to
do duty in the battle-field, he faltered not, swerved not,
compromised not, retracted not, apologized not, but pursued
his way with an inflexibility as rare as it is grand and inspiring.
Others might doubt&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;not he. He saw the end toward
which the nation and himself must strive. That was ever
present to him, and toward that he ever worked. His mission
as President was, as he so often and so pointedly stated, to
save the Union. And he saved it. There may be those who
will contend that such a result might have been reached by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">387</a></span>
other means than those he was impelled to employ. That is
theory. He reduced his to practice. For himself, he could
work only in his own harness; and patiently, persistently,
painfully he worked on till the goal was reached.</p>

<p>Well has Washington been styled the Father of his Country.
Yet this arose from veneration rather than from love; for
the most felt such an impassable gulf between themselves
and the patriot-hero, that to them he appeared of quite
another order of beings than themselves.</p>

<p>Abraham Lincoln was both Saviour and Father; for he
preserved whatever was most valuable in the old and created
a new order of things possessing an inherent dignity and
importance which the old never had. And such titles the
people bestow upon him through love.</p>

<p>The characteristics of the man stood prominently out in
the statesman. He had not one garb as an official and
another as a citizen. No change marked his transit from the
chat of the drawing-room to the consultation of cabinet.
What he was in the one situation he was in the other. His
peculiar humor was not, as those who least knew him judged,
his habitual disposition. More of melancholy and sadness
centred in him than most were aware. His favorite poem&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;given
below for the sufficient reason that it was his favorite&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;attests
the vein of pensiveness which was in him. &#8220;There
is one poem,&#8221; he remarked in conversation, &#8220;that is almost
continually present with me: it comes in my mind whenever
I have relief from thought and care.&#8221;</p>

<p>No one was more modest than he. Look at the record of
his life as furnished by himself, in 1858, for Lanman&#8217;s
Dictionary of Congress:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;Born February 12, 1809, in Hardin county, Kentucky.</p>

<p>&#8220;Education Defective.</p>

<p>&#8220;Profession a lawyer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have been a captain of volunteers in the Black Hawk war.</p>

<p>&#8220;Postmaster at a very small office.</p>

<p>&#8220;Four times a member of the Illinois Legislature.</p>

<p>&#8220;And was a member of the lower House of Congress.</p>

<p class="in4">&#8220;Yours, etc.,      <span class="right"><span class="smcap">A. Lincoln</span>.&#8221;</span><br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>With no self-conceit, a pupil in the school of events, he
was never ashamed to confess himself a learner, and as such
he grew and ripened. Equable in his temperament, never
wrathful or passionate, none need have been his enemy, unless
such an one were intended for an enemy of the human
race. Mild and forgiving, he never allowed the unmerited
abuse which was heaped upon him to affect in the least his
intercourse or dealings with its authors. His very failings
leaned to mercy&#8217;s side. There is scarcely a hamlet in the
loyal States that does not contain some witness of his clemency
and lenity. One of the most touching incidents connected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">390</a></span>
with his obsequies at Washington was the placing on
his coffin of a wreath of flowers, sent from Boston by the
sister of a young man whom he had pardoned when sentenced
to death for some military offence.</p>

<p>Honored as a private citizen, happy in his domestic relations,
successful as a statesman, he was, moreover, an avowed
Christian. He often said that his reliance in the gloomiest
hours was on his God, to whom he appealed in prayer, although
he had never become a professor of religion. To a
clergyman who asked him if he loved his Saviour, he replied:</p>

<p>&#8220;When I was first inaugurated I did not love him; when
God took my son I was greatly impressed, but still I did not
love him; but when I stood upon the battle-field of Gettysburg
I gave my heart to Christ, and I can now say I do love
the Saviour.&#8221;</p>

<p>Attention has already been called to the reverential spirit
which pervades his official papers; and this was the index of
the man. Leaving home, he invoked the prayers of his
townsmen and friends; during the excitements of his Washington
life, he leaned upon a more than human arm; against
his pure moral character not even his bitterest enemy could
truthfully utter a word.</p>

<p>Such&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;imperfectly sketched, and at best but in rude outline&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;was
Abraham Lincoln. The manner of his death invests
his name with a tragic interest. This will be but

<h3>SPEECH ON THE MEXICAN WAR.</h3>

<p class="p1 b1 center">(<i>In Committee of the Whole House, January 12, 1848.</i>)</p>

<p>Mr. Lincoln addressed the Committee as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Mr. Chairman</span>:&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;Some, if not all, of the gentlemen on
the other side of the House, who have addressed the Committee
within the last two days, have spoken rather complainingly,
if I have rightly understood them, of the vote
given a week or ten days ago, declaring that the war with
Mexico was unnecessarily and unconstitutionally commenced
by the President. I admit that such a vote should not be
given in mere party wantonness, and that the one given is
justly censurable, if it have no other or better foundation.
I am one of those who joined in that vote; and did so under
my best impression of the <i>truth</i> of the case. How I got this
impression, and how it may possibly be removed, I will now
try to show. When the war began, it was my opinion that
all those who, because of knowing too <i>little</i>, or because of
knowing too <i>much</i>, could not conscientiously approve the
conduct of the President (in the beginning of it), should,
nevertheless, as good citizens and patriots, remain silent on
that point, at least till the war should be ended. Some leading
Democrats, including ex-President Van Buren, have taken
this same view, as I understand them; and I adhered to it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">392</a></span>
and acted upon it, until since I took my seat here; and I
think I should still adhere to it, were it not that the President
and his friends will not allow it to be so. Besides, the
continual effort of the President to argue every silent vote
given for supplies into an indorsement of the justice and
wisdom of his conduct; besides that singularly candid paragraph
in his late message, in which he tells us that Congress,
with great unanimity (only two in the Senate and fourteen in
the House dissenting) had declared that &#8216;by the act of the
Republic of Mexico a state of war exists between that Government
and the United States;&#8217; when the same journals that
informed him of this, also informed him that, when that
declaration stood disconnected from the question of supplies,
sixty-seven in the House, and not fourteen, merely, voted
against it; besides this open attempt to prove by telling the
<i>truth</i>, what he could not prove by telling the <i>whole truth</i>,
demanding of all who will not submit to be misrepresented,
in justice to themselves, to speak out; besides all this, one
of my colleagues [Mr. Richardson], at a very early day in the
session, brought in a set of resolutions, expressly indorsing
the original justice of the war on the part of the President.
Upon these resolutions, when they shall be put on their passage,
I shall be <i>compelled</i> to vote; so that I can not be silent
if I would. Seeing this, I went about preparing myself to
give the vote understandingly, when it should come. I carefully
examined the President&#8217;s messages, to ascertain what he
himself had said and proved upon the point. The result of
this examination was to make the impression, that, taking for
true all the President states as facts, he falls far short of
proving his justification; and that the President would have
gone further with his proof, if it had not been for the small
matter that the <i>truth</i> would not permit him. Under the impression
thus made I gave the vote before mentioned. I
propose now to give, concisely, the process of the examination
I made, and how I reached the conclusion I did.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">393</a></span>
&#8220;The President, in his first message of May, 1846, declares
that the soil was <i>ours</i> on which hostilities were commenced
by Mexico; and he repeats that declaration, almost in the
same language, in each successive annual message&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;thus
showing that he esteems that point a highly essential one.
In the importance of that point I entirely agree with the
President. To my judgment, it is the <i>very point</i> upon which
he should be justified or condemned. In his message of
December, 1846, it seems to have occurred to him, as is certainly
true, that title, ownership to soil, or any thing else, is
not a simple fact, but is a conclusion following one or more
simple facts; and that it was incumbent upon him to present
the facts from which he concluded the soil was ours on which
the first blood of the war was shed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Accordingly, a little below the middle of page twelve, in
the message last referred to, he enters upon that task; forming
an issue and introducing testimony, extending the whole
to a little below the middle of page fourteen. Now, I propose
to try to show that the whole of this&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;issue and evidence&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;is,
from beginning to end, the sheerest deception. The
issue, as he presents it, is in these words: &#8216;But there are
those who, conceding all this to be true, assume the ground
that the true western boundary of Texas is the Nueces,
instead of the Rio Grande; and that, therefore, in marching
our army to the east bank of the latter river, we passed the
Texan line, and invaded the territory of Mexico.&#8217; Now, this
issue is made up of two affirmatives and no negative. The
main deception of it is, that it assumes as true that <i>one</i> river
or the <i>other</i> is necessarily the boundary, and cheats the
superficial thinker entirely out of the idea that <i>possibly</i> the
boundary is somewhere <i>between</i> the two, and not actually at
either. A further deception is, that it will let in <i>evidence</i>
which a true issue would exclude. A true issue made by the
President would be about as follows: &#8216;I say the soil <i>was ours</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">394</a></span>
on which the first blood was shed; there are those who say
it was not.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;I now proceed to examine the President&#8217;s evidence, as
applicable to such an issue. When that evidence is analyzed
it is all included in the following propositions:</p>

<p>&#8220;1. That the Rio Grande was the western boundary of
Louisiana, as we purchased it of France in 1803.</p>

<p>&#8220;2. That the Republic of Texas always <i>claimed</i> the Rio
Grande as her western boundary.</p>

<p>&#8220;3. That, by various acts, she had claimed it <i>on paper</i>.</p>

<p>&#8220;4. That Santa Anna, in his treaty with Texas, recognized
the Rio Grande as her boundary.</p>

<p>&#8220;5. That Texas <i>before</i>, and the United States <i>after</i> annexation,
had <i>exercised</i> jurisdiction <i>beyond</i> the Nueces, <i>between</i>
the two rivers.</p>

<p>&#8220;6. That our Congress <i>understood</i> the boundary of Texas
to extend beyond the Nueces.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now for each of these in its turn:</p>

<p>&#8220;His first item is, that the Rio Grande was the western
boundary of Louisiana, as we purchased it of France in 1803;
and, seeming to expect this to be disputed, he argues over the
amount of nearly a page to prove it true; at the end of which
he lets us know that, by the treaty of 1819, we sold to Spain
the whole country, from the Rio Grande eastward to the
Sabine. Now, admitting for the present, that the Rio Grande
was the boundary of Louisiana, what, under heaven, had that
to do with the <i>present</i> boundary between us and Mexico?
How, Mr. Chairman, the line that once divided your land
from mine can <i>still</i> be the boundary between us <i>after</i> I have
sold my land to you, is, to me, beyond all comprehension.
And how any man, with an honest purpose only of proving
the truth, could ever have <i>thought</i> of introducing such a fact
to prove such an issue, is equally incomprehensible. The
outrage upon common <i>right</i>, of seizing as our own what we
have once sold, merely because it <i>was</i> ours <i>before</i> we sold it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">395</a></span>
is only equaled by the outrage on common <i>sense</i> of any attempt
to justify it.</p>

<p>&#8220;The President&#8217;s next piece of evidence is, that &#8216;The Republic
of Texas always <i>claimed</i> this river (Rio Grande) as
her western boundary.&#8217; That is not true, in fact. Texas <i>has</i>
claimed it, but she has not <i>always</i> claimed it. There is, at
least, one distinguished exception. Her State Constitution&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;the
public&#8217;s most solemn and well-considered act; that which
may, without impropriety, be called her last will and testament,
revoking all others&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;makes no such claim. But suppose
she had always claimed it. Has not Mexico always
claimed the contrary? So that there is but <i>claim</i> against
<i>claim</i>, leaving nothing proved until we get back of the claims,
and find which has the better <i>foundation</i>.</p>

<p>&#8220;Though not in the order in which the President presents
his evidence, I now consider that class of his statements,
which are, in substance, nothing more than that Texas has
by various acts of her Convention and Congress, claimed the
Rio Grande as her boundary&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;<i>on paper</i>. I mean here what
he says about the fixing of the Rio Grande as her boundary,
in her old Constitution (not her State Constitution), about
forming congressional districts, counties, etc. Now, all this
is but naked <i>claim</i>; and what I have already said about
claims is strictly applicable to this. If I should claim your
land by word of mouth, that certainly would not make it
mine; and if I were to claim it by a deed which I had made
myself, and with which you had nothing to do, the claim
would be quite the same in substance, or rather in utter
nothingness.</p>

<p>&#8220;I next consider the President&#8217;s statement that Santa
Anna, in his <i>treaty</i> with Texas, recognized the Rio Grande as
the western boundary of Texas. Besides the position so often
taken that Santa Anna, while a prisoner of war&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;a captive&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;<i>could</i>
not bind Mexico by a treaty, which I deem conclusive;
besides this, I wish to say something in relation to this treaty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">396</a></span>
so called by the President, with Santa Anna. If any man
would like to be amused by a sight at that <i>little</i> thing, which
the President calls by that <i>big</i> name, he can have it by turning
to Niles&#8217; Register, volume 50, page 386. And if any one
should suppose that Niles&#8217; Register is a curious repository
of so mighty a document as a solemn treaty between nations,
I can only say that I learned, to a tolerable degree of certainty,
by inquiry at the State Department, that the President
himself never saw it anywhere else. By the way, I believe I
should not err if I were to declare, that during the first ten
years of the existence of that document, it was never by anybody
<i>called</i> a treaty; that it was never so called till the
President, in his extremity, attempted, by so calling it, to
wring something from it in justification of himself in connection
with the Mexican war. It has none of the distinguishing
features of a treaty. It does not call itself a treaty. Santa
Anna does not therein assume to bind Mexico; he assumes
only to act as President, Commander-in-chief of the Mexican
army and navy; stipulates that the then present hostilities
should cease, and that he would not <i>himself</i> take up arms,
nor <i>influence</i> the Mexican people to take up arms, against
Texas, during the existence of the war of independence. He
did not recognize the independence of Texas; he did not assume
to put an end to the war, but clearly indicated his expectation
of its continuance; he did not say one word about
boundary, and most probably never thought of it. It <i>is</i>
stipulated therein that the Mexican forces should evacuate the
territory of Texas, <i>passing to the other side of the Rio Grande</i>;
and in another article it is stipulated, that to prevent collisions
between the armies, the Texan army should not approach
nearer than five leagues&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;of <i>what</i> is not said&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;but clearly,
from the object stated, it is of the Rio Grande. Now, if this
is a treaty recognizing the Rio Grande as a boundary of
Texas, it contains the singular feature of stipulating that
Texas shall not go within five leagues of <i>her own</i> boundary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">397</a></span>
&#8220;Next comes the evidence that Texas before annexation,
and the United States afterward, exercising jurisdiction beyond
the Nueces, and <i>between</i> the two rivers. This actual
<i>exercise</i> of jurisdiction is the very class or quality of evidence
we want. It is excellent so far as it goes; but does it go far
enough? He tells us it went <i>beyond</i> the Nueces, but he does
not tell us it went <i>to</i> the Rio Grande. He tells us jurisdiction
was exercised <i>between</i> the two rivers, but he does not tell us
it was exercised over <i>all</i> the territory between them. Some
simple-minded people think it possible to cross one river and
go beyond it, without going all the way to the next; that
jurisdiction may be exercised <i>between</i> two rivers without
covering <i>all</i> the country between them. I know a man, not
very unlike myself, who exercises jurisdiction over a piece of
land between the Wabash and the Mississippi; and yet so
far is this from being <i>all</i> there is between those rivers, that it
is just one hundred and fifty-two feet long by fifty wide, and
no part of it much within a hundred miles of either. He has
a neighbor between him and the Mississippi&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;that is, just
across the street, in that direction&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;whom, I am sure, he
could neither <i>persuade</i> nor <i>force</i> to give up his habitation;
but which, nevertheless he could certainly annex, if it were
to be done, by merely standing on his own side of the street
and claiming it, or even sitting down and writing a deed for it.</p>

<p>&#8220;But next, the President tells us, the Congress of the
United States <i>understood</i> the State of Texas they admitted
into the Union to extend <i>beyond</i> the Nueces. Well, I suppose
they did&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;I certainly so understand it&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;but how <i>far</i>
beyond? That Congress did <i>not</i> understand it to extend
clear to the Rio Grande, is quite certain by the fact of their
joint resolutions for admission expressly leaving all questions
of boundary to future adjustment. And, it may be added,
that Texas herself is proved to have had the same understanding
of it that our Congress had, by the fact of the exact
conformity of her new Constitution to those resolutions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">398</a></span>
&#8220;I am now through the whole of the President&#8217;s evidence;
and it is a singular fact, that if any one should declare the
President sent the army into the midst of a settlement of
Mexican people, who had never submitted, by consent or by
force to the authority of Texas or of the United States, and
that <i>there</i>, and <i>thereby</i>, the first blood of the war was shed,
there is not one word in all the President has said which
would either admit or deny the declaration. In this strange
omission chiefly consists the deception of the President&#8217;s evidence&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;an
omission which, it does seem to me, could scarcely
have occurred but by design. My way of living leads me to
be about the courts of justice; and there I have sometimes
seen a good lawyer, struggling for his client&#8217;s neck, in a
desperate case, employing every artifice to work round, befog,
and cover up with many words some position pressed upon
him by the prosecution, which he <i>dared</i> not admit, and yet
<i>could</i> not deny. Party bias may help to make it appear so;
but, with all the allowance I can make for such bias, it still
does appear to me that just such and from just such necessity,
are the President&#8217;s struggles in this case.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some time after my colleague (Mr. Richardson) introduced
the resolutions I have mentioned, I introduced a preamble,
resolution, and interrogatories, intended to draw the
President out, if possible, on this hitherto untrodden ground.
To show their relevancy, I propose to state my understanding
of the true rule for ascertaining the boundary between Texas
and Mexico. It is, that <i>wherever</i> Texas was <i>exercising</i> jurisdiction
was hers; and wherever Mexico was exercising jurisdiction
was hers: and that whatever separated the actual
exercise of jurisdiction of the one from that of the other, was
the true boundary between them. If, as is probably true,
Texas was exercising jurisdiction along the western bank of
the Nueces, and Mexico was exercising it along the eastern
bank of the Rio Grande, then <i>neither</i> river was the boundary,
but the uninhabited country between the two was. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">399</a></span>
extent of our territory in that region depended not on any
<i>treaty-fixed</i> boundary (for no treaty had attempted it), but on
revolution. Any people anywhere, being inclined and having
the power, have the <i>right</i> to rise up and shake off the existing
government, and form a new one that suits them better.
This is a most valuable, a most sacred right&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;a right which,
we hope and believe, is to liberate the world. Nor is this
right confined to cases in which the whole people of an existing
government may choose to exercise it. Any portion of
such people that <i>can</i> may revolutionize, and make their <i>own</i>
of so much of their territory as they inhabit. More than
this, a <i>majority</i> of any portion of such people may revolutionize,
putting down a <i>minority</i>, intermingled with, or near
about them, who may oppose their movements. Such minority
was precisely the case of the Tories of our own Revolution.
It is a quality of revolutions not to go by old lines, or old
laws; but to break up both and make new ones. As to the
country now in question, we bought it of France in 1803,
and sold it to Spain in 1819, according to the President&#8217;s
statement. After this, all Mexico, including Texas, revolutionized
against Spain; and still later, Texas revolutionized
against Mexico. In my view, just so far as she carried her
revolution, by obtaining the <i>actual</i>, willing or unwilling submission
of the people, so <i>far</i> the country was hers, and no
further.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, sir, for the purpose of obtaining the very best evidence
as to whether Texas had actually carried her revolution
to the place where the hostilities of the present war commenced,
let the President answer the interrogatories I proposed,
as before mentioned, or some other similar ones. Let
him answer fully, fairly and candidly. Let him answer with
<i>facts</i>, and not with arguments. Let him remember he sits
where Washington sat; and, so remembering, let him answer
as Washington would answer. As a nation <i>should</i> not, and
the Almighty <i>will</i> not, be evaded, so let him attempt no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">400</a></span>
evasion, no equivocation. And if, so answering, he can show
that the soil was ours where the first blood of the war was
shed&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;that it was not within an inhabited country, or, if
within such, that the inhabitants had submitted themselves
to the civil authority of Texas, or of the United States, and
that the same is true of the site of Fort Brown&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;then I am
with him for his justification. In that case, I shall be most
happy to reverse the vote I gave the other day. I have a
selfish motive for desiring that the President may do this; I
expect to give some votes, in connection with the war, which,
without his so doing, will be of doubtful propriety, in my
own judgment, but which will be free from the doubt if he
does so. But if he <i>can not or will not</i> do this,&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;if, on any
pretence, or no pretence, he shall refuse or omit it,&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;then I
shall be fully convinced, of what I more than suspect already,
that he is deeply conscious of being in the wrong; that he
feels the blood of this war, like the blood of Abel, is crying
to heaven against him; that he ordered General Taylor into
the midst of a peaceful Mexican settlement, purposely to
bring on a war; that originally having some strong motive&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;what
I will not stop now to give my opinion concerning&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;to
involve the two countries in a war, and trusting to escape
scrutiny by fixing the public gaze upon the exceeding brightness
of military glory&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;that attractive rainbow that rises in
showers of blood&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;that serpent&#8217;s eye that charms to destroy&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;he
plunged into it, and has swept <i>on</i> and <i>on</i>, till, disappointed
in his calculation of the ease with which Mexico might be
subdued, he now finds himself he knows not where. How
like the half insane mumbling of a fever dream is the whole
war part of the late message! At one time telling us that
Mexico has nothing whatever that we can get but territory;
at another, showing us how we can support the war by levying
contributions on Mexico. At one time urging the national
honor, the security of the future, the prevention of foreign
interference, and even the good of Mexico herself, as among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">401</a></span>
the objects of the war; at another, telling us that, &#8216;to reject
indemnity by refusing to accept a cession of territory, would
be to abandon all our just demands, and to wage the war,
bearing all its expenses, <i>without a purpose or definite object</i>.&#8217;
So, then, the national honor, security of the future, and everything
but territorial indemnity, may be considered the <i>no
purposes</i> and <i>indefinite</i> objects of the war! But having it
now settled that territorial indemnity is the only object, we
are urged to seize, by legislation here, all that he was content
to take a few months ago, and the whole province of Lower
California to boot, and to still carry on the war&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;to take <i>all</i>
we are fighting for, and <i>still</i> fight on. Again, the President is
resolved, under all circumstances, to have full territorial indemnity
for the expenses of the war; but he forgets to tell
us how we are to get the <i>excess</i> after those expenses shall
have surpassed the value of the <i>whole</i> of the Mexican territory.
So, again, he insists that the separate national existence
of Mexico shall be maintained; but he does not tell us <i>how</i>
this can be done after we shall have taken <i>all</i> her territory.
Lest the question I here suggest be considered speculative
merely, let me be indulged a moment in trying to show they
are not.</p>

<p>&#8220;The war has gone on some twenty months; for the expenses
of which, together with an inconsiderable old score,
the President now claims about one-half of the Mexican
territory, and that by far the better half, so far as concerns our
ability to make any thing out of it. It is comparatively uninhabited;
so that we could establish land offices in it, and
raise some money in that way. But the other half is already
inhabited, as I understand it, tolerably densely for the nature
of the country; and all its lands, or all that are valuable,
already appropriated as private property. How, then, are we
to make any thing out of these lands with this incumbrance
on them, or how remove the incumbrance? I suppose no
one will say that we shall kill the people, or drive them out,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">402</a></span>
or make slaves of them, or even confiscate their property?
How, then, can we make much out of this part of the territory?
If the prosecution of the war has, in expenses, already
equalled the <i>better</i> half of the country, how long its future
prosecution will be in equalling the less valuable half is not
a <i>speculative</i> but a <i>practical</i> question, pressing closely upon
us; and yet it is a question which the President seems never
to have thought of.</p>

<p>&#8220;As to the mode of terminating the war and securing
peace, the President is equally wandering and indefinite.
First, it is to be done by a more vigorous prosecution of the
war in the vital parts of the enemy&#8217;s country; and, after
apparently talking himself tired on this point, the President
drops down into a half despairing tone, and tells us, that
&#8216;with a people distracted and divided by contending factions,
and a government subject to constant changes, by successive
revolutions, <i>the continued success of our arms may fail to
obtain a satisfactory peace</i>.&#8217; Then he suggests the propriety
of wheedling the Mexican people to desert the counsels of
their own leaders, and, trusting in our protection, to set up a
government from which we can secure a satisfactory peace,
telling us that &#8216;<i>this may become the only mode of obtaining
such a peace</i>.&#8217; But soon he falls into doubt of this too, and
then drops back on to the already half abandoned ground of
&#8216;more vigorous prosecution.&#8217; All this shows that the President
is in no wise satisfied with his own positions. First, he
takes up one, and, in attempting to argue us into it, he argues
himself <i>out</i> of it; then seizes another, and goes through the
same process; and then, confused at being able to think of
nothing new, he snatches up the old one again, which he has
some time before cast off. His mind, tasked beyond its power,
is running hither and thither, like some tortured creature on
a burning surface, finding no such position on which it can
settle down and be at ease.</p>

<p>&#8220;Again, it is a singular omission in this message, that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">403</a></span>
nowhere intimates <i>when</i> the President expects the war to
terminate. At its beginning, General Scott was, by this same
President driven into disfavor, if not disgrace, for intimating
that peace could not be conquered in less than three or four
months. But now at the end of about twenty months, during
which time our arms have given us the most splendid successes&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;every
department, and every part, land and water,
officers and privates, regulars and volunteers, doing all that
men could do, and hundreds of things which it had ever
before been thought that men could <i>not</i> do; after all this,
this same President gives us a long message without showing
us that <i>as to the end</i>, he has himself even an imaginary conception.
As I have before said, he knows not where he is.
He is a bewildered, confounded, and miserably-perplexed
man. God grant he may be able to show that there is not
something about his conscience more painful than all his
mental perplexity.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<h3>SPEECH ON INTERNAL IMPROVEMENTS.</h3>

<p class="center p1 b1">(<i>In Committee of the Whole House, June 20, 1848.</i>)</p>

<p>Mr. Lincoln said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Mr. Chairman</span>:&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;I wish at all times in no way to practice
any fraud upon the House or the Committee, and I also

in taking the floor is to make a speech on the general subject
of internal improvements; and if I am out of order in doing
so I give the Chair an opportunity of so deciding, and I will
take my seat.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Chair.&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;&#8220;I will not undertake to anticipate what the

Mr. Lincoln.&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;&#8220;At an early day of this session the President
sent to us what may properly be termed an internal
improvement veto message. The late Democratic Convention
which sat at Baltimore, and which nominated General
Cass for the Presidency, adopted a set of resolutions, now
called the Democratic platform, among which is one in these
words:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;That the Constitution does not confer upon the General
Government the power to commence and carry on a general
system of internal improvements.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;General Cass, in his letter accepting the nomination, holds
this language:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I have carefully read the resolutions of the Democratic
National Convention, laying down the platform of our political
faith, and I adhere to them as firmly as I approve them
cordially.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;These things, taken together, show that the question of
internal improvements is now more distinctly made&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;has
become more intense, than at any former period. It can no
longer be avoided. The veto message and the Baltimore
resolution I understand to be, in substance, the same thing;
the latter being the more general statement, of which the
former is the amplification&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;the bill of particulars. While I
know there are many Democrats, on this floor and elsewhere,
who disapprove that message, I understand that all who shall
vote for General Cass will thereafter be considered as having
approved it, as having indorsed all its doctrines. I suppose
all, or nearly all, the Democrats will vote for him. Many of
them will do so, not because they like his position on this
question, but because they prefer him, being wrong in this,
to another, whom they consider further wrong on other
questions. In this way the internal improvement Democrats
are to be, by a sort of forced consent, carried over, and
arrayed against themselves on this measure of policy. General
Cass, once elected, will not trouble himself to make a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">405</a></span>
Constitutional argument, or, perhaps, any argument at all,
when he shall veto a river or harbor bill. He will consider
it a sufficient answer to all Democratic murmurs, to point to
Mr. Polk&#8217;s message, and to the &#8220;Democratic platform.&#8221;
This being the case, the question of improvements is verging
to a final crisis; and the friends of the policy must now
battle, and battle manfully, or surrender all. In this view,
humble as I am, I wish to review, and contest as well as I
may, the general positions of this veto message. When I
say <i>general</i> positions, I mean to exclude from consideration
so much as relates to the present embarrassed state of the
Treasury, in consequence of the Mexican war.</p>

<p>&#8220;Those general positions are: That internal improvements
ought not to be made by the General Government:</p>

<p>&#8220;1. Because they would overwhelm the treasury;</p>

<p>&#8220;2. Because, while their <i>burdens</i> would be general, their
<i>benefits</i> would be <i>local</i> and <i>partial</i>, involving an obnoxious
inequality;</p>

<p>&#8220;3. Because they would be unconstitutional;</p>

<p>&#8220;4. Because the States may do enough by the levy and
collection of tonnage duties; or, if not,</p>

<p>&#8220;5. That the Constitution may be amended.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Do nothing at all, lest you do something wrong,&#8217; is the
sum of these positions&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;is the sum of this message; and this,
with the exception of what is said about Constitutionality,
applying as forcibly to making improvements by State authority
as by the national authority. So that we must abandon
the improvements of the country altogether, by any and
every authority, or we must resist and repudiate the doctrines
of this message. Let us attempt the latter.</p>

<p>&#8220;The first position is, that a system of internal improvement
would overwhelm the treasury.</p>

<p>&#8220;That, in such a system, there is a <i>tendency</i> to undue expansion,
is not to be denied. Such tendency is founded in the
nature of the subject. A member of Congress will prefer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">406</a></span>
voting for a bill which contains an appropriation for his district,
to voting for one which does not; and when a bill shall
be expanded till every district shall be provided for, that it
will be too greatly expanded is obvious. But is this any
more true in Congress than in a State Legislature? If a
member of Congress must have an appropriation for his district,
so a member of a Legislature must have one for his
county; and if one will overwhelm the national treasury, so
the other will overwhelm the State treasury. Go where we
will, the difficulty is the same. Allow it to drive us from the
halls of Congress, and it will just as easily drive us from the
State Legislatures. Let us, then, grapple with it, and test
its strength. Let us, judging of the future by the past,
ascertain whether there may not be, in the discretion of Congress,
a sufficient power to limit and restrain this expansive
tendency within reasonable and proper bounds. The President
himself values the evidence of the past. He tells us
that at a certain point of our history, more than two hundred
millions of dollars had been <i>applied for</i>, to make improvements,
and this he does to prove that the treasury would be
overwhelmed by such a system. Why did he not tell us
how much was <i>granted</i>? Would not that have been better
evidence? Let us turn to it, and see what it proves. In
the message, the President tells us that &#8216;during the four
succeeding years, embraced by the administration of President
Adams, the power not only to appropriate money, but
to apply it, under the direction and authority of the General
Government, as well to the construction of roads as to the
improvement of harbors and rivers, was fully asserted and
exercised.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;This, then, was the period of greatest enormity. These,
if any, must have been the days of the two hundred millions.
And how much do you suppose was really expended for improvements
during those four years? Two hundred millions?
One hundred? Fifty? Ten? Five? No, sir, less than two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">407</a></span>
millions. As shown by authentic documents, the expenditures
on improvements during 1825, 1826, 1827 and 1828,
amounted to $1,879,627 01. These four years were the
period of Mr. Adams&#8217; administration, nearly, and substantially.
This fact shows that when the power to make improvements
was &#8216;fully asserted and exercised,&#8217; the Congress
<i>did</i> keep within reasonable limits; and what <i>has</i> been done
it seems to me, <i>can</i> be done again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now for the second position of the message, namely, that
the burdens of improvements would be <i>general</i>, while their
<i>benefits</i> would be <i>local</i> and <i>partial</i>, involving an obnoxious
inequality. That there is some degree of truth in this position
I shall not deny. No commercial object of Government
patronage can be so exclusively <i>general</i>, as not to be of some
peculiar <i>local</i> advantage; but on the other hand, nothing is
so <i>local</i> as not to be of some general advantage. The navy,
as I understand it, was established, and is maintained, at a
great annual expense, partly to be ready for war, when war
shall come, but partly also, and perhaps chiefly, for the protection
of our commerce on the high seas. This latter object
is, for all I can see, in principle, the same as internal improvements.
The driving a pirate from the track of commerce on
the broad ocean, and the removing a snag from its more
narrow path in the Mississippi river, can not, I think, be distinguished
in principle. Each is done to save life and property,
and for nothing else. The navy, then, is the most
general in its benefits of all this class of objects; and yet even
the navy is of some peculiar advantage to Charleston, Baltimore,
Philadelphia, New York and Boston, beyond what it
is to the interior towns of Illinois. The next most general
object I can think of, would be improvements on the Mississippi
river and its tributaries. They touch thirteen of our
States&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;Pennsylvania, Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee, Mississippi,
Louisiana, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana,
Ohio, Wisconsin, and Iowa. Now, I suppose it will not be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">408</a></span>
denied, that these thirteen States are a little more interested
in improvements on that great river than are the remaining
seventeen. These instances of the navy, and the Mississippi
river show clearly that there is something of local advantage
in the most general objects. But the converse is also true.
Nothing is so <i>local</i> as not to be of some <i>general</i> benefit.
Take, for instance, the Illinois and Michigan canal. Considered
apart from its effects, it is perfectly local. Every
inch of it is within the State of Illinois. That canal was first
opened for business last April. In a very few days we were
all gratified to learn, among other things, that sugar had been
carried from New Orleans, through the canal, to Buffalo, in
New York. This sugar took this route, doubtless, because
it was cheaper than the old route. Supposing the benefit in
the reduction of the cost of carriage to be shared between
seller and buyer, the result is, that the New Orleans merchant
sold his sugar a little <i>dearer</i>, and the people of Buffalo
sweetened their coffee a little <i>cheaper</i> than before; a benefit
resulting <i>from</i> the canal, not to Illinois, where the canal <i>is</i>,
but to Louisiana and New York, where the canal is <i>not</i>. In
other transactions Illinois will, of course, have her share, and
perhaps the larger share too, in the benefits of the canal; but
the instance of the sugar clearly shows that the <i>benefits</i> of an
improvement are by no means confined to the particular
locality of the improvement itself.</p>

<p>&#8220;The just conclusion from all this is, that if the nation
refuse to make improvements of the more general kind,
because their benefits may be somewhat local, a State may
for the same reason, refuse to make an improvement of a local
kind, because its benefits may be somewhat general. A State
may well say to the Nation: &#8216;If you will do nothing for me,
I will do nothing for you.&#8217; Thus it is seen, that if this
argument of &#8216;inequality&#8217; is sufficient anywhere, it is sufficient
everywhere, and puts an end to improvements altogether.
I hope and believe, that if both the Nation and the States<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">409</a></span>
would, in faith, in their respective spheres, do what they
could in the way of improvements, what of inequality might
be produced in one place might be compensated in another
and that the sum of the whole might not be very unequal.
But suppose, after all, there should be some degree of inequality:
inequality is certainly never to be embraced for its
own sake; but is every good thing to be discarded which may
be inseparably connected with some degree of it? If so, we
must discard all government. This Capitol is built at the
public expense, for the public benefit; but does any one doubt
that it is of some peculiar local advantage to the property
holders and business people of Washington? Shall we remove
it for this reason? And if so, where shall we set it
down, and be free from the difficulty? To make sure of our
object shall we locate it nowhere, and leave Congress hereafter
to hold its sessions as the loafer lodged, &#8216;in spots
about?&#8217; I make no special allusion to the present President
when I say, there are few stronger cases in this world of
&#8216;burden to the many, and benefit to the few&#8217;&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;of &#8216;inequality&#8217;&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;than
the Presidency itself is by some thought to be. An
honest laborer digs coal at about seventy cents a day, while
the President digs abstractions at about seventy dollars a
day. The <i>coal</i> is clearly worth more than the <i>abstractions</i>,
and yet what a monstrous inequality in the prices! Does
the President, for this reason, propose to abolish the Presidency?
He <i>does</i> not, and he <i>ought</i> not. The true rule, in
determining to embrace or reject any thing, is not whether
it have <i>any</i> evil in it, but whether it have more of evil than
of good. There are few things <i>wholly</i> evil or <i>wholly</i> good;
almost every thing, especially of government policy, is an
inseparable compound of the two; so that our best judgment
of the preponderance between them is continually demanded.
On this principle the President, his friends, and the world
generally, act on most subjects. Why not apply it, then,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">410</a></span>
upon this question? Why, as to improvements, magnify the
<i>evil</i>, and stoutly refuse to see any good in them?</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Chairman, on the third position of the message (the
Constitutional question) I have not much to say. Being the
man I am, and speaking when I do, I feel that in any attempt
at an original, Constitutional argument, I should not be, and
ought not to be, listened to patiently. The ablest and the
best of men have gone over the whole ground long ago. I
shall attempt but little more than a brief notice of what some
of them have said. In relation to Mr. Jefferson&#8217;s views, I
read from Mr. Polk&#8217;s veto message:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;President Jefferson, in his message to Congress in 1806,
recommended an amendment of the Constitution, with a view
to apply an anticipated surplus in the treasury &#8216;to the great
purposes of the public education, roads, rivers, canals, and
such other objects of public improvements as it may be
thought proper to add to the Constitutional enumeration of
the Federal powers.&#8217; And he adds: &#8216;I suppose an amendment
to the Constitution, by consent of the States, necessary
because the objects now recommended are not among those
enumerated in the Constitution, and to which it permits the
public moneys to be applied.&#8217; In 1825, he repeated, in his
published letters, the opinion that no such power had been
conferred upon Congress.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;I introduce this, not to controvert, just now, the Constitutional
opinion, but to show, that on the question of <i>expediency</i>,
Mr. Jefferson&#8217;s opinion was against the present President&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;that
this opinion of Mr. Jefferson, in one branch at
least, is, in the hands of Mr. Polk, like McFingal&#8217;s gun:</p>

<div class="center-container"><div class="poem">
<span class="i0">&#8220;&#8216;Bears wide and kicks the owner over.&#8217;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>&#8220;But, to the Constitutional question. In 1826, Chancellor
Kent first published his Commentaries on American Law.
He devoted a portion of one of the lectures to the question
of the authority of Congress to appropriate public moneys for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">411</a></span>
internal improvements. He mentions that the question had
never been brought under judicial consideration, and proceeds
to give a brief summary of the discussions it had undergone
between the legislative and executive branches of the Government.
He shows that the legislative branch had usually
been <i>for</i>, and the executive <i>against</i>, the power, till the period
of Mr. J.&nbsp;Q. Adams&#8217; administration; at which point he considers
the executive influence as withdrawn from opposition,
and added to the support of the power. In 1844, the Chancelor
published a new edition of his Commentaries, in which
he adds some notes of what had transpired on the question
since 1826. I have not time to read the original text, or the
notes, but the whole may be found on page 267, and the two
or three following pages of the first volume of the edition of
1844. As what Chancellor Kent seems to consider the sum
of the whole, I read from one of the notes:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Mr. Justice Story, in his Commentaries on the Constitution
of the United States, vol. 2, page 429&ndash;440, and again,
page 519&ndash;538, has stated at large the arguments for and
against the proposition that Congress have a Constitutional
authority to lay taxes, and to apply the power to regulate
commerce, as a means directly to encourage and protect
domestic manufactures; and, without giving any opinion of
his own on the contested doctrine, he has left the reader to
draw his own conclusion. I should think, however, from the
arguments as stated, that every mind which has taken no part
in the discussions, and felt no prejudice or territorial bias on
either side of the question, would deem the arguments in
favor of the Congressional power vastly superior.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;It will be seen, that in this extract, the power to make
improvements is not directly mentioned; but by examining
the context, both of Kent and of Story, it will appear that
the power mentioned in the extract and the power to make
improvements, are regarded as identical. It is not to be
denied that many great and good men have been <i>against</i> the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">412</a></span>
power; but it is insisted that quite as many, as great, and as
good, have been <i>for</i> it; and it is shown that, on a full survey
of the whole, Chancelor Kent was of opinion that the arguments
of the latter were <i>vastly</i> superior. This is but the
opinion of a man; but who was that man? He was one of
the ablest and most learned lawyers of his age, or of any
other age. It is no disparagement to Mr. Polk, nor, indeed,
to any one who devotes much time to politics, to be placed
far behind Chancelor Kent as a lawyer. His attitude was
most favorable to correct conclusions. He wrote coolly and
in retirement. He was struggling to rear a durable monument
of fame; and he well knew that <i>truth</i> and thoroughly
sound reasoning were the only sure foundations. Can the
party opinion of a party President, on a law question, as this
purely is, be at all compared or set in opposition to that of
such a man, in such an attitude as Chancelor Kent?</p>

<p>&#8220;This Constitutional question will probably never be better
settled than it is, until it shall pass under judicial consideration;
but I do think that no man who is clear on this question
of expediency need feel his conscience much pricked
upon this.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Chairman, the President seems to think that enough
may be done in the way of improvements, by means of tonnage
duties, under State authority, with the consent of the
General Government. Now, I suppose this matter of tonnage
duties is well enough in its own sphere. I suppose it may
be efficient, and perhaps <i>sufficient</i>, to make slight improvements
and repairs in harbors already in use, and not much
out of repair. But if I have any correct general idea of it,
it must be wholly inefficient for any generally beneficent purposes
of improvement. I know very little, or rather nothing
at all, of the practical matter of levying and collecting tonnage
duties; but I suppose one of its principles must be, to
lay a duty, for the improvement of any particular harbor,
<i>upon the tonnage coming into that harbor</i>. To do otherwise&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">413</a></span>
collect money in <i>one</i> harbor to be expended in improvements
in <i>another</i>&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;would be an extremely aggravated form
of that inequality which the President so much deprecates.
If I be right in this, how could we make any entirely new
improvements by means of tonnage duties? How make a
road, a canal, or clear a greatly obstructed river? The idea
that we could, involves the same absurdity of the Irish bull
about the new boots: &#8216;I shall never git &#8216;em on,&#8217; says Patrick,
&#8217;till I wear &#8217;em a day or two, and stretch &#8217;em a little.&#8217;
We shall never make a canal by tonnage duties, until it shall
already have been made awhile, so the tonnage can get
into it.</p>

<p>&#8220;After all, the President concludes that possibly there
may be some great objects of improvements which can not be
effected by tonnage duties, and which, therefore, may be expedient
for the General Government to take in hand. Accordingly,
he suggests, in case any such be discovered, the
propriety of amending the Constitution. Amend it for what?
If, like Mr. Jefferson, the President thought improvements
<i>expedient</i> but not Constitutional, it would be natural enough
for him to recommend such an amendment; but hear what
he says in this very message:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;In view of these portentous consequences, I can not but
think that this course of legislation should be arrested, even
were there nothing to forbid it in the fundamental laws of
our Union.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;For what, then, would <i>he</i> have the Constitution amended?
With <i>him</i> it is a proposition to remove <i>one</i> impediment,
merely to be met by <i>others</i>, which, in his opinion, can not be
removed&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;to enable Congress to do what, in his opinion, they
ought not to do if they could.&#8221;</p>

<p>[Here Mr. Meade, of Virginia, inquired if Mr. L. understood
the President to be opposed, on grounds of expediency,
to any and every improvement?]</p>

<p>To which Mr. Lincoln answered: &#8220;In the very part of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">414</a></span>
message of which I am now speaking, I understand him as
giving some vague expressions in favor of some possible
objects of improvement; but, in doing so, I understand him
to be directly in the teeth of his own arguments in other parts
of it. Neither the President, nor any one, can possibly
specify an improvement, which shall not be clearly liable to
one or another of the objections he has urged on the score of
expediency; I have shown, and might show again, that no
work&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;no object&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;can be so general, as to dispense its benefits
with precise equality; and this inequality is chief among the
&#8216;portentous consequences&#8217; for which he declares that improvements
should be arrested. No, sir; when the President
intimates that something in the way of improvements may
properly be done by the General Government, he is shrinking
from the conclusions to which his own arguments would
force him. He feels that the improvements of this broad and
goodly land are a mighty interest; and he is unwilling to
confess to the people, or perhaps to himself, that he has built
an argument which, when pressed to its conclusion, entirely
annihilates this interest.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have already said that no one who is satisfied of the
expediency of making improvements need be much uneasy in
his conscience about its Constitutionality. I wish now to
submit a few remarks on the general proposition of amending
the Constitution. As a General rule, I think we would do
much better to let it alone. No slight occasion should tempt
us to touch it. Better not take the first step, which may
lead to a habit of altering it. Better rather habituate ourselves
to think of it as unalterable. It can scarcely be made
better than it is. New provisions would introduce new difficulties,
and thus create and increase appetite for further
change. No, sir; let it stand as it is. New hands have
never touched it. The men who made it have done their
work, and have passed away. Who shall improve on what
<i>they</i> did?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">415</a></span>
&#8220;Mr. Chairman, for the purpose of reviewing this message
in the least possible time, as well as for the sake of distinctness,
I have analyzed its arguments as well as I could, and
reduced them to the propositions I have stated. I have now
examined them in detail. I wish to detain the committee
only a little while longer, with some general remarks on the
subject of improvements. That the subject is a difficult one,
can not be denied. Still, it is no more difficult in Congress
than in the State legislatures, in the counties or in the
smallest municipal districts which everywhere exist. All
can recur to instances of this difficulty in the case of county
roads, bridges, and the like. One man is offended because a
road passes over his land; and another is offended because it
does <i>not</i> pass over his; one is dissatisfied because the bridge,
for which he is taxed, crosses the river on a different road
from that which leads from his house to town; another can
not bear that the county should get in debt for these same
roads and bridges; while not a few struggle hard to have
roads located over their lands, and then stoutly refuse to let
them be opened, until they are first paid the damages. Even
between the different wards and streets of towns and cities,
we find this same wrangling and difficulty. Now, these are
no other than the very difficulties against which, and out of
which, the President constructs his objections of &#8216;inequality,&#8217;
&#8216;speculation,&#8217; and &#8216;crushing the Treasury.&#8217; There is but a
single alternative about them&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;they are <i>sufficient</i>, or they
are <i>not</i>. If sufficient, they are sufficient <i>out</i> of Congress as
well as <i>in</i> it, and there is the end. We must reject them
as insufficient, or lie down and do nothing by any authority.
Then, difficulty though there be, let us meet and overcome it.</p>

<div class="center-container"><div class="poem">
<span class="i0">&#8216;Attempt the end, and never stand to doubt;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nothing so hard, but search will find it out.&#8217;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>&#8220;Determine that the thing can and shall be done, and
then we shall find the way. The tendency to undue expansion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">416</a></span>
is unquestionably the chief difficulty. How to do <i>something</i>,
and still not to do <i>too much</i>, is the desideratum. Let
each contribute his mite in the way of suggestion. The late
Silas Wright, in a letter to the Chicago Convention, contributed
his, which was worth something; and I now contribute
mine, which may be worth nothing. At all events, it will
mislead nobody, and therefore will do no harm. I would not
borrow money. I am against an overwhelming, crushing
system. Suppose that at each session, Congress shall first
determine <i>how much</i> money can, for that year, be spared for
improvements; then apportion that sum to the most <i>important</i>
objects. So far all is easy; but how shall we determine
which <i>are</i> the most important? On this question comes the
collision of interests. <i>I</i> shall be slow to acknowledge that
<i>your</i> harbor or <i>your</i> river is more important than <i>mine</i>, and
<i>vice versa</i>. To clear this difficulty, let us have that same
statistical information which the gentleman from Ohio [Mr.
Vinton] suggested at the beginning of this session. In that
information we shall have a stern, unbending basis of <i>facts</i>&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;a
basis in nowise subject to whim, caprice, or local interest.
The pre-limited amount of means will save us from doing <i>too
much</i>, and the statistics will save us from doing what we do
in <i>wrong places</i>. Adopt and adhere to this course, and, it
seems to me, the difficulty is cleared.</p>

<p>&#8220;One of the gentlemen from South Carolina (Mr. Rhett)
very much deprecates these statistics. He particularly objects,
as I understand him, to counting all the pigs and
chickens in the land. I do not perceive much force in the
objection. It is true, that if every thing be enumerated, a
portion of such statistics may not be very useful to this object.
Such products of the country as are to be <i>consumed</i>
where they are <i>produced</i>, need no roads and rivers, no means
of transportation, and have no very proper connection with
this subject. The <i>surplus</i>, that which is produced in <i>one</i>
place to be consumed in <i>another</i>; the capacity of each locality<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">417</a></span>
for producing a <i>greater</i> surplus; the natural means of transportation,
and their susceptibility of improvement; the hindrances,
delays, and losses of life and property during
transportation, and the causes of each, would be among the
most valuable statistics in this connection. From these it
would readily appear where a given amount of expenditure
would do the most good. These statistics might be equally
accessible, as they would be equally useful, to both the Nation
and the States. In this way, and by these means, let the
nation take hold of the larger works, and the States the
smaller ones; and thus, working in a meeting direction, discreetly,
but steadily and firmly, what is made unequal in one
place may be equalized in another, extravagance avoided, and
the whole country put on that career of prosperity, which
shall correspond with its extent of territory, its natural resources,
and the intelligence and enterprise of its people.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<h3>SPEECH ON THE PRESIDENCY AND GENERAL POLITICS.</h3>

<p class="center p1 b1">(<i>Delivered in the House, July 27, 1848.</i>)</p>

<p class="center p1 b1">GENERAL TAYLOR AND THE VETO POWER.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;Mr. <span class="smcap">Speaker</span>:&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;Our Democratic friends seem to be in
great distress because they think our candidate for the Presidency
don&#8217;t suit <i>us</i>. Most of them can not find out that
General Taylor has any principles at all; some, however,
have discovered that he has <i>one</i>, but that that one is entirely
wrong. This one principle is his position on the veto power.
The gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Stanton) who has just
taken his seat, indeed, has said there is very little if any difference
on this question between General Taylor and all the
Presidents; and he seems to think it sufficient detraction from
General Taylor&#8217;s position on it, that it has nothing new in it.
But all others whom I have heard speak assail it furiously.
A new member from Kentucky (Mr. Clarke) of very considerable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">418</a></span>
ability, was in particular concern about it. He thought
it altogether novel and unprecedented for a President, or a
Presidential candidate, to think of approving bills whose
Constitutionality may not be entirely clear to his own mind.
He thinks the ark of our safety is gone, unless Presidents shall
always veto such bills as, in their judgment, may be of <i>doubtful</i>
Constitutionality. However clear Congress may be of
their authority to pass any particular act, the gentleman
from Kentucky thinks the President must veto it if <i>he</i> has
<i>doubts</i> about it. Now I have neither time nor inclination to
argue with the gentleman on the veto power as an original
question; but I wish to show that General Taylor, and not
he, agrees with the earliest statesmen on this question. When
the bill chartering the first Bank of the United States passed
Congress, its Constitutionality was questioned; Mr. Madison,
then in the House of Representatives, as well as others, had
opposed it on that ground. General Washington, as President,
was called on to approve or reject it. He sought and
obtained, on the Constitutional question, the separate written
opinions of Jefferson, Hamilton, and Edmund Randolph, they
then being respectively Secretary of State, Secretary of the
Treasury, and Attorney General. Hamilton&#8217;s opinion was
for the power; while Randolph&#8217;s and Jefferson&#8217;s were both
against it. Mr. Jefferson, in his letter dated February 15th,
1791, after giving his opinion decidedly against the Constitutionality
of that bill, closed with the paragraph which I now
read:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;It must be admitted, however, that unless the President&#8217;s
mind, on a view of every thing which is urged for and
against this bill, is tolerably clear that it is unauthorized by
the Constitution; if the pro and the con hang so even as to
balance his judgment, a just respect for the wisdom of the
Legislature would naturally decide the balance in favor of
their opinion; it is chiefly for cases where they are clearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">419</a></span>
misled by error, ambition, or interest, that the Constitution
has placed a check in the negative of the President.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;General Taylor&#8217;s opinion, as expressed in his Allison
letter, is as I now read:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;The power given by the veto is a high conservative
power; but, in my opinion, should never be exercised, except
in cases of clear violation of the Constitution, or manifest
haste and want of consideration by Congress.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is here seen that, in Mr. Jefferson&#8217;s opinion, if, on the
Constitutionality of any given bill, the President <i>doubts</i>, he is
not to veto it, as the gentleman from Kentucky would have
him to do, but is to defer to Congress and approve it. And
if we compare the opinions of Jefferson and Taylor, as expressed
in these paragraphs, we shall find them more exactly
alike than we can often find any two expressions having any
literal difference. None but interested fault-finders, can discover
any substantial variation.</p>

<p>&#8220;But gentlemen on the other side are unanimously agreed
that Gen. Taylor has no other principle. They are in utter
darkness as to his opinions on any of the questions of policy
which occupy the public attention. But is there any doubt
as to what he will <i>do</i> on the prominent question, if elected?
Not the least. It is not possible to know what he will or
would do in every imaginable case; because many questions
have passed away, and others doubtless will arise which none
of us have yet thought of; but on the prominent questions of
currency, tariff, internal improvements, and Wilmot proviso,
General Taylor&#8217;s course is at least as well defined as is General
Cass&#8217;s. Why, in their eagerness to get at General Taylor,
several Democratic members here have desired to know
whether, in case of his election, a bankrupt law is to be established.
Can they tell us General Cass&#8217;s opinion on this
question? (Some member answered, &#8216;He is against it.&#8217;)
Aye, how do you know he is? There is nothing about it in
the platform, nor elsewhere, that I have seen. If the gentleman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">420</a></span>
knows any thing which I do not, he can show it. But
to return: General Taylor, in his Allison letter says:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Upon the subject of the tariff, the currency, the improvement
of our great highways, rivers, lakes, and harbors,
the will of the people, as expressed through their Representatives
in Congress, ought to be respected and carried out
by the Executive.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, this is the whole matter&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;in substance, it is this:
The people say to General Taylor, &#8216;If you are elected shall
we have a National bank?&#8217; He answers, &#8216;<i>Your</i> will, gentlemen,
not <i>mine</i>.&#8217; &#8216;What about the tariff?&#8217; &#8216;Say yourselves.&#8217;
&#8216;Shall our rivers and harbors be improved?&#8217; &#8216;Just as you
please.&#8217; &#8216;If you desire a bank, an alteration of the tariff, internal
improvements, any or all, I will not hinder you; if you
do not desire them, I will not attempt to force them on you.
Send up your members of Congress from the various districts,
with opinions according to your own, and if they are
for these measures, or any of them, I shall have nothing to
oppose; if they are not for them, I shall not, by any appliances
whatever, attempt to dragoon them into their adoption.&#8217;
Now, can there be any difficulty in understanding this? To
you, Democrats, it may not seem like principle; but surely
you can not fail to perceive the position plain enough. The
distinction between it and the position of your candidate is
broad and obvious, and I admit you have a clear right to show
it is wrong, if you can; but you have no right to pretend you
can not see it at all. We see it, and to us it appears like
principle, and the best sort of principle at that&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;the principle
of allowing the people to do as they please with their own
business. My friend from Indiana (Mr. C.&nbsp;B. Smith) has
aptly asked, &#8216;Are you willing to trust the people?&#8217; Some of
you answered, substantially, &#8216;We are willing to trust the
people; but the President is as much the representative of
the people as Congress.&#8217; In a certain sense, and to a certain
intent, he is the representative of the people. He is elected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">421</a></span>
by them, as well as Congress is. But can he, in the nature
of things, know the wants of the people as well as three hundred
other men coming from all the various localities of the
Nation? If so, where is the propriety of having a Congress?
That the Constitution gives the President a negative on
legislation, all know; but that this negative should be so
combined with platforms and other appliances as to enable
him, and, in fact, almost compel him, to take the whole of legislation
into his own hands, is what we object to&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;is what General
Taylor objects to&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;and is what constitutes the broad distinction
between you and us. To thus transfer legislation is
clearly to take it from those who understand with minuteness
the interests of the people, and give it to one who does not
and can not so well understand it. I understand your idea,
that if a Presidential candidate avow his opinion upon a
given question, or rather upon all questions, and the people,
with full knowledge of this, elect him, they thereby distinctly
approve all those opinions. This, though plausible, is a most
pernicious deception. By means of it measures are adopted
or rejected, contrary to the wishes of the whole of one party,
and often nearly half of the other. The process is this:
Three, four, or half a dozen questions are prominent at a
given time; the party selects its candidate, and he takes his
position on each of these questions. On all but one his positions
have already been indorsed at former elections, and his
party fully committed to them; but that one is new, and a
large portion of them are against it. But what are they to do?
The whole are strung together, and they must take all or
reject all. They can not take what they like and leave the
rest. What they are already committed to, being the majority,
they shut their eyes and gulp the whole. Next election,
still another is introduced in the same way. If we run
our eyes along the line of the past, we shall see that almost,
if not quite, all the articles of the present Democratic creed
have been at first forced upon the party in this very way.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">422</a></span>
And just now, and just so, opposition to internal improvements
is to be established if Gen. Cass shall be elected.
Almost half the Democrats here are for improvements, but
they will vote for Cass, and if he succeeds, their votes will
have aided in closing the doors against improvements. Now,
this is a process which we think is wrong. We prefer a candidate
who, like Gen. Taylor, will allow the people to have
their own way regardless of his private opinion; and I should
think the internal-improvement Democrats at least, ought to
prefer such a candidate. He would force nothing on them
which they don&#8217;t want, and he would allow them to have
improvements, which their own candidate, if elected, will not.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Speaker, I have said Gen. Taylor&#8217;s position is as well
defined as is that of Gen. Cass. In saying this, I admit
I do not certainly know what he would do on the Wilmot
proviso. I am a Northern man, or, rather, a Western free
State man, with a constituency I believe to be, and with personal
feelings I know to be, against the extension of slavery.
As such, and with what information I have, I hope, and <i>believe</i>,
Gen. Taylor, if elected, would not veto the proviso; but
I do not <i>know</i> it. Yet, if I knew he would, I still would
vote for him. I should do so, because, in my judgment, his
election alone can defeat Gen. Cass; and because, <i>should</i>
slavery thereby go into the territory we now have, just
so much will certainly happen by the election of Cass; and,
in addition, a course of policy leading to new wars, new
acquisitions of territory, and still further extensions of
slavery. One of the two is to be President; which is preferable?</p>

<p>&#8220;But there is as much doubt of Cass on improvements
as there is of Taylor on the proviso. I have no doubt myself
of Gen. Cass on this question, but I know the Democrats
differ among themselves as to his position. My internal improvement
colleague (Mr. Wentworth) stated on this floor
the other day, that he was satisfied Cass was for improvements,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">423</a></span>
because he had voted for all the bills that he (Mr.
W.) had. So far so good. But Mr. Polk vetoed some of
these very bills; the Baltimore Convention passed a set of
resolutions, among other things, approving these vetoes, and
Cass declares, in his letter accepting the nomination, that
he has carefully read these resolutions, and that he adheres
to them as firmly as he approves them cordially. In other
words, Gen. Cass voted for the bills, and thinks the President
did right to veto them; and his friends here are amiable
enough to consider him as being on one side or the other,
just as one or the other may correspond with their own respective
inclinations. My colleague admits that the platform
declares against the Constitutionality of a general system of
improvement, and that Gen. Cass indorses the platform; but
he still thinks Gen. Cass is in favor of some sort of improvements.
Well, what are they? As he is against <i>general</i>
objects, those he is <i>for</i>, must be <i>particular</i> and <i>local</i>. Now,
this is taking the subject precisely by the wrong end. <i>Particularity</i>&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;expending
the money of the <i>whole</i> people for an
object which will benefit only a <i>portion</i> of them, is the
greatest real objection to improvements, and has been so held
by Gen. Jackson, Mr. Polk, and all others, I believe, till now.
But now, behold, the objects most general, nearest free from
this objection, are to be rejected, while those most liable to it
are to be embraced. To return: I can not help believing
that Gen. Cass, when he wrote his letter of acceptance, well
understood he was to be claimed by the advocates of both
sides of this question, and that he then closed the door
against all further expressions of opinion, purposely to retain
the benefits of that double position. His subsequent equivocation
at Cleveland, to my mind, proves such to have been
the case.</p>

<p>&#8220;One word more, and I shall have done with this branch
of the subject. You Democrats, and your candidate, in the
main are in favor of laying down, in advance, a platform&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;a set<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">424</a></span>
of party positions, as a unit; and then of enforcing the
people, by every sort of appliance, to ratify them, however
unpalatable some of them may be. We, and our candidate,
are in favor of making Presidential elections and the legislation
of the country distinct matters; so that the people can
elect whom they please, and afterward legislate just <i>as</i> they
please, without any hindrance, save only so much as may
guard against infractions of the Constitution, undue haste,
and want of consideration. The difference between us is
clear as noonday. That we are right we can not doubt.
We hold the true Republican position. In leaving the
people&#8217;s business in their hands we can not be wrong. We
are willing, and even anxious, to go to the people on this
issue.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I suppose I can not reasonably hope to convince you
that we have any principles. The most I can expect is, to
assure you that we think we have, and are quite contented
with them. The other day, one of the gentlemen from
Georgia (Mr. Iverson), an eloquent man, and a man of
learning, so far as I can judge, not being learned myself,
came down upon us astonishingly. He spoke in what the
Baltimore <i>American</i> calls the &#8216;scathing and withering style.&#8217;
At the end of his second severe flash I was struck blind, and
found myself feeling with my fingers for an assurance of my
continued physical existence. A little of the bone was left,
and I gradually revived. He eulogized Mr. Clay in high
and beautiful terms, and then declared that we had deserted
all our principles, and had turned Henry Clay out, like an
old horse, to root. This is terribly severe. It can not be
answered by argument; at least, I can not so answer it. I
merely wish to ask the gentleman if the Whigs are the only
party he can think of, who sometimes turn old horses out to
root? Is not a certain Martin Van Buren an old horse
which your own party have turned out to root? and is he not
rooting a little to your discomfort about now? But in not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">425</a></span>
nominating Mr. Clay, we deserted our principles, you say.
Ah! in what? Tell us, ye men of principles what principle
we violated? We say you did violate principle in discarding
Van Buren, and we can tell you how. You violated the
primary, the cardinal, the one great living principle of all
Democratic representative government&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;the principle that
the representative is bound to carry out the known will of his
constituents. A large majority of the Baltimore Convention
of 1844 were, by their constituents, instructed to procure
Van Buren&#8217;s nomination if they could. In violation, in
utter, glaring contempt of this, you rejected him&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;rejected
him, as the gentlemen from New York (Mr. Birdsall), the
other day expressly admitted, for <i>availability</i>&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;that same
&#8216;general availability&#8217; which you charge upon us, and daily
chew over here, as something exceedingly odious and unprincipled.
But the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Iverson),
gave us a second speech yesterday, all well considered and
put down in writing, in which Van Buren was scathed and
withered a &#8216;few&#8217; for his present position and movements. I
can not remember the gentlemen&#8217;s precise language, but I do
remember he put Van Buren down, down, till he got him
where he was finally to &#8216;stink&#8217; and &#8216;rot.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Speaker, it is no business or inclination of mine to
defend Martin Van Buren. In the war of extermination now
waging between him and his old admirers, I say, devil take
the hindmost&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;and the foremost. But there is no mistaking
the origin of the breach; and if the curse of &#8216;stinking&#8217; and
&#8216;rotting&#8217; is to fall on the first and greatest violaters of principle
in the matter, I disinterestedly suggest, that the gentleman
from Georgia and his present co-workers are bound to
take it upon themselves.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. Lincoln then proceeded to speak of the objections
against Gen. Taylor as a mere military hero; retorting with
effect, by citing the attempt to make out a military record for
Gen. Cass; and referring, in a bantering way, to his own services<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">426</a></span>
in the Black Hawk war, as already quoted. He then
said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;While I have Gen. Cass in hand, I wish to say a word
about his political principles. As a specimen, I take the record
of his progress on the Wilmot Proviso. In the Washington
Union, of March 2, 1847, there is a report of the speech
of Gen. Cass, made the day before in the Senate, on the
Wilmot Proviso, during the delivery of which, Mr. Miller, of
New Jersey, is reported to have interrupted him as follows,
to wit:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Mr. Miller expressed his great surprise at the change in
the sentiments of the Senator from Michigan, who had been
regarded as the great champion of freedom in the North-west
of which he was a distinguished ornament. Last year the
Senator from Michigan was understood to be decidedly in
favor of the Wilmot Proviso; and, as no reason had been
stated for the change, he (Mr. Miller) could not refrain from
the expression of his extreme surprise.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;To this Gen. Cass is reported to have replied as follows,
to wit:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Cass said, that the course of the Senator from New
Jersey was most extraordinary. Last year he (Mr. Cass)
should have voted for the proposition had it come up. But
circumstances had altogether changed. The honorable Senator
then read several passages from the remarks as given
above, which he had committed to writing, in order to refute
such a charge as that of the Senator from New Jersey.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;In the &#8216;remarks above committed to writing,&#8217; is one numbered
4, as follows, to wit:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;4th. Legislation would now be wholly imperative, because
no territory hereafter to be acquired can be governed
without an act of Congress providing for its government.
And such an act, on its passage, would open the whole subject,
and leave the Congress, called on to pass it, free to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">427</a></span>
exercise its own discretion, entirely uncontrolled by any
declaration found in the statute book.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;In Niles&#8217; Register, vol. 73, page 293, there is a letter of
General Cass to A.&nbsp;O.&nbsp;P. Nicholson, of Nashville, Tennessee
dated December 24, 1847, from which the following are correct
extracts:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;The Wilmot Proviso has been before the country some
time. It has been repeatedly discussed in Congress, and by
the public press. I am strongly impressed with the opinion
that a great change has been going on in the public mind
upon this subject&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;in my own as well as others; and that
doubts are resolving themselves into convictions, that the
principle it involves should be kept out of the National Legislature,
and left to the people of the Confederacy in their
respective local Governments.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Briefly, then, I am opposed to the exercise of any jurisdiction
by Congress over this matter; and I am in favor of
leaving the people of any territory which may be hereafter
acquired, the right to regulate it themselves, under the
general principles of the Constitution. Because,</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;1. I do not see in the Constitution any grant of the
requisite power to Congress; and I am not disposed to
extend a doubtful precedent beyond its necessity&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;the establishment
of territorial governments when needed&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;leaving to
the inhabitants all the rights compatible with the relations
they bear to the Confederation.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;These extracts show that, in 1846, General Cass was for
the Proviso <i>at once</i>; that, in March, 1847, he was still for it,
<i>but not just then</i>; and that in December, 1847, he was <i>against</i>
it altogether. This is a true index to the whole man. When
the question was raised in 1846, he was in a blustering hurry
to take ground for it. He sought to be in advance, and to
avoid the uninteresting position of a mere follower, but soon
he began to see glimpses of the great Democratic ox-gad waving
in his face, and to hear indistinctly, a voice saying, &#8216;back,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">428</a></span>&#8217;
&#8216;back, sir,&#8217; &#8216;back a little.&#8217; He shakes his head and bats his
eyes, and blunders back to his position of March, 1847; but
still the gad waves, and the voice grows more distinct, and
sharper still&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;&#8216;back, sir!&#8217; &#8216;back, I say!&#8217; &#8216;further back!&#8217; and
back he goes to the position of December, 1847; at which
the gad is still, and the voice soothingly says&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;&#8216;So!&#8217; &#8216;Stand
still at that.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have no fears, gentlemen, of your candidate; he exactly
suits you, and we congratulate you upon it. However much
you may be distressed about <i>our</i> candidate, you have all
cause to be contented and happy with your own. If elected,
he may not maintain all, or even any of his positions previously
taken; but he will be sure to do whatever the party
exigency, for the time being, may require; and that is precisely
what you want. He and Van Buren are the same
&#8216;manner of men;&#8217; and like Van Buren, he will never desert
<i>you</i> till you first desert <i>him</i>.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>After referring at some length to extra &#8220;charges&#8221; of General
Cass upon the Treasury, Mr. Lincoln <span class="locked">continued:&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;But I have introduced General Cass&#8217;s accounts here,
chiefly to show the wonderful physical capacities of the man.
They show that he not only did the labor of several men at
the same <i>time</i>, but that he often did it, at several <i>places</i> many
hundred miles apart, <i>at the same time</i>. And at eating, too,
his capacities are shown to be quite as wonderful. From
October, 1821, to May, 1822, he ate ten rations a day in
Michigan, ten rations a day here, in Washington, and nearly
five dollar&#8217;s worth a day besides, partly on the road between
the two places. And then there is an important discovery in
his example&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;the art of being paid for what one eats, instead
of having to pay for it. Hereafter, if any nice young man
shall owe a bill which he can not pay in any other way, he
can just board it out. Mr. Speaker, we have all heard of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">429</a></span>
animal standing in doubt between two stacks of hay, and
starving to death; the like of that would never happen to
General Cass. Place the stacks a thousand miles apart, he
would stand stock-still, midway between them, and eat them
both at once; and the green grass along the line would be
apt to suffer some too, at the same time. By all means
make him President, gentlemen. He will feed you bounteously&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;if
if&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;there is any left after he shall have helped
himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;But as General Taylor, is, par excellence, the hero of the
Mexican war; and, as you Democrats say we Whigs have
always opposed the war, you think it must be very awkward
and embarrassing for us to go for General Taylor. The
declaration that we have always opposed the war, is true or
false accordingly as one may understand the term &#8216;opposing
the war.&#8217; If to say &#8216;the war was unnecessarily and unconstitutionally
commenced by the President,&#8217; be opposing the
war, then the Whigs have very generally opposed it. Whenever
they have spoken at all, they have said this; and they
have said it on what has appeared good reason to them:
The marching an army into the midst of a peaceful Mexican
settlement, frightening the inhabitants away, leaving their
growing crops and other property to destruction, to <i>you</i> may
appear a perfectly amiable, peaceful, unprovoking procedure;
but it does not appear so to <i>us</i>. So to call such an act, to
us appears no other than a naked, impudent absurdity, and
we speak of it accordingly. But if, when the war had begun,
and had become the cause of the country, the giving of our
money and our blood, in common with yours, was support of
the war, then it is not true that we have always opposed the
war. With few individual exceptions, you have constantly
had our votes here for all the necessary supplies. And, more
than this, you have had the services, the blood, and the lives
of our political brethren in every trial, and on every field.
The beardless boy and the mature man&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;the humble and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">430</a></span>
distinguished, you have had them. Through suffering and
death, by disease and in battle, they have endured, and fought,
and fallen with you. Clay and Webster each gave a son,
never to be returned. From the State of my own residence,
besides other worthy but less known Whig names, we sent
Marshall, Morrison, Baker, and Hardin; they all fought, and
one fell, and in the fall of that one, we lost our best Whig
man. Nor were the Whigs few in number, or laggard in the
day of danger. In that fearful, bloody, breathless struggle at
Buena Vista, where each man&#8217;s hard task was to beat back
five foes, or die himself, of the five high officers who perished,
four were Whigs.</p>

<p>&#8220;In speaking of this, I mean no odious comparison between
the lion-hearted Whigs and Democrats who fought there.
On other occasions, and among the lower officers and privates
on <i>that</i> occasion, I doubt not the proportion was different. I
wish to do justice to all. I think of all those brave men as
Americans, in whose proud fame, as an American, I too have
a share. Many of them, Whigs and Democrats, are my constituents
and personal friends; and I thank them&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;more than
thank them&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;one and all, for the high, imperishable honor
they have conferred on our common State.</p>

<p>&#8220;But the distinction between the cause of the <i>President</i> in
beginning the war, and the cause of the <i>country</i> after it was
begun, is a distinction which you can not perceive. To <i>you</i>,
the President and the country seem to be all one. You are
interested to see no distinction between them; and I venture
to suggest that <i>possibly</i> your interest blinds you a little.
We see the distinction, as we think, clearly enough; and our
friends, who have fought in the war, have no difficulty in seeing
it also. What those who have fallen would say, were
they alive and here, of course we can never know; but with
those who have returned there is no difficulty. Colonel Haskell
and Major Gaines, members here, both fought in the
war; and one of them underwent extraordinary perils and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">431</a></span>
hardships; still they, like all other Whigs here, vote on the
record that the war was unnecessarily and unconstitutionally
commenced by the President. And even General Taylor himself,
the noblest Roman of them all, has declared that, as a
citizen, and particularly as a soldier, it is sufficient for him to
know that his country is at war with a foreign nation, to do
all in his power to bring it to a speedy and honorable termination,
by the most vigorous and energetic operations, without
inquiring about its justice, or any thing else connected
with it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Speaker, let our Democratic friends be comforted with
the assurance that we are content with our position, content
with our company, and content with our candidate; and that
although they, in their generous sympathy, think we ought to
be miserable, we really are not, and that they may dismiss the
great anxiety they have on <i>our</i> account.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<h3>SPEECH IN REPLY TO MR. DOUGLAS, ON KANSAS, THE DRED
SCOTT DECISION, AND THE UTAH QUESTION.</h3>

<p class="center p1 b1">(<i>Delivered at Springfield, Ill., June 26, 1857.</i>)</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Fellow-Citizens</span>:&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;I am here, to-night, partly by the
invitation of some of you, and partly by my own inclination.
Two weeks ago Judge Douglas spoke here, on the several
subjects of Kansas, the Dred Scott decision, and Utah. I
listened to the speech at the time, and have read the report
of it since. It was intended to controvert opinions which I
think just, and to assail (politically, not personally) those
men who, in common with me, entertain those opinions. For
this reason I wished then, and still wish to make some answer
to it which I now take the opportunity of doing.</p>

<p>&#8220;I begin with Utah. If it prove to be true, as is probable,
that the people of Utah are in open rebellion against the
United States, then Judge Douglas is in favor of repealing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">432</a></span>
their territorial organization, and attaching them to the adjoining
States for judicial purposes. I say, too, if they are
in rebellion, they ought to be somehow coerced to obedience;
and I am not now prepared to admit or deny, that the
Judge&#8217;s mode of coercing them is not as good as any. The
Republicans can fall in with it, without taking back any thing
they have ever said. To be sure, it would be a considerable
backing down by Judge Douglas, from his much vaunted
doctrine of self-government for the territories; but this is only
additional proof of what was very plain from the beginning,
that that doctrine was a mere deceitful pretence for the benefit
of slavery. Those who could not see that much in the
Nebraska act itself, which forced Governors, and Secretaries,
and Judges on the people of the territories, without their
choice or consent, could not be made to see, though one
should rise from the dead.</p>

<p>&#8220;But in all this, it is very plain the Judge evades the only
question the Republicans have ever pressed upon the Democracy
in regard to Utah. That question the Judge well knew
to be this: &#8216;If the people of Utah shall peacefully form a
State Constitution tolerating polygamy, will the Democracy
admit them into the Union?&#8217; There is nothing in the United
States Constitution or law against polygamy; and why is it
not a part of the Judge&#8217;s &#8216;sacred right of self-government&#8217;
for the people to have it, or rather to keep it, if they choose?
These questions, so far as I know, the Judge never answers.
It might involve the Democracy to answer them either way
and they go unanswered.</p>

<p>&#8220;As to Kansas. The substance of the Judge&#8217;s speech on
Kansas, is an effort to put the Free State men in the wrong
for not voting at the election of delegates to the Constitutional
Convention. He says: &#8216;There is every reason to hope and
believe that the law will be fairly interpreted and impartially
executed, so as to insure to every bona fide inhabitant the
free and quiet exercise of the elective franchise.&#8217;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">433</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;It appears extraordinary that Judge Douglas should
make such a statement. He knows that, by the law, no one
can vote who has not been registered; and he knows that the
Free State men place their refusal to vote on the ground that
but few of them have been registered. It is possible this is
not true, but Judge Douglas knows it is asserted to be true
in letters, newspapers, and public speeches, and borne by
every mail, and blown by every breeze to the eyes and ears
of the world. He knows it is boldly declared, that the people
of many whole counties, and many whole neighborhoods
in others, are left unregistered; yet he does not venture to
contradict the declaration, or to point out how they can vote
without being registered; but he just slips along, not seeming
to know there is any such question of fact, and complacently
declares, &#8216;There is every reason to hope and believe
that the law will be fairly and impartially executed, so as to
insure to every bona fide inhabitant the free and quiet exercise
of the elective franchise.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;I readily agree that if all had a chance to vote, they
ought to have voted. If, on the contrary, as they allege, and
Judge Douglas ventures not particularly to contradict, few
only of the Free State men had a chance to vote, they were
perfectly right in staying from the polls in a body.</p>

<p>&#8220;By the way, since the Judge spoke, the Kansas election
has come off. The Judge expressed his confidence that all
the Democrats in Kansas would do their duty&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;including
&#8216;Free State Democrats&#8217; of course. The returns received
here, as yet, are very incomplete; but, so far as they go, they
indicate that only about one-sixth of the registered voters,
have really voted; and this, too, when not more, perhaps,
than one-half of the rightful voters have been registered, thus
showing the thing to have been altogether the most exquisite
farce ever enacted. I am watching with considerable interest,
to ascertain what figure &#8216;the Free State Democrats&#8217; cut
in the concern. Of course they voted&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;all Democrats do their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">434</a></span>
duty&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;and of course they did not vote for Slave State candidates.
We soon shall know how many delegates they elected,
how many candidates they have pledged to a free State, and
how many votes were cast for them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Allow me to barely whisper my suspicion, that there
were no such things in Kansas as &#8216;Free State Democrats&#8217;&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;that
they were altogether mythical, good only to figure in
newspapers and speeches in the free States. If there should
prove to be one real, living free State Democrat in Kansas, I
suggest that it might be well to catch him, and stuff and preserve
his skin, as an interesting specimen of that soon to be
extinct variety of the genus Democrat.</p>

<p>&#8220;And now, as to the Dred Scott decision. That decision
declares two propositions&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;first, that a negro cannot sue in
the United States Courts; and secondly, that Congress can
not prohibit slavery in the Territories. It was made by a
divided court&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;dividing differently on the different points.
Judge Douglas does not discuss the merits of the decision,
and in that respect, I shall follow his example, believing I
could no more improve upon McLean and Curtis, than he
could on Taney.</p>

<p>&#8220;He denounces all who question the correctness of that
decision, as offering violent resistance to it. But who resists
it? Who has, in spite of the decision, declared Dred Scott
free, and resisted the authority of his master over him?</p>

<p>&#8220;Judicial decisions have two uses&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;first, to absolutely determine
the case decided; and secondly to indicate to the
public how other similar cases will be decided when they
arise. For the latter use, they are called &#8216;precedents&#8217; and
&#8216;authorities.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;We believe as much as Judge Douglas (perhaps more)
in obedience to, and respect for the judicial department of
Government. We think its decisions on Constitutional questions,
when fully settled, should control, not only the particular
cases decided, but the general policy of the country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">435</a></span>
subject to be disturbed only by amendments of the Constitution,
as provided in that instrument itself. More than this
would be revolution. But we think the Dred Scott decision
is erroneous. We know the court that made it has often
overruled its own decisions, and we shall do what we can to
have it overrule this. We offer no resistance to it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Judicial decisions are of greater or less authority as precedents,
according to circumstances. That this should be so,
accords both with common sense, and the customary understanding
of the legal profession.</p>

<p>&#8220;If this important decision had been made by the unanimous
concurrence of the judges, and without any apparent
partisan bias, and in accordance with legal public expectation,
and with the steady practice of the departments, throughout
our history, and had been in no part based on assumed historical
facts which are not really true; or, if wanting in some
of these, it had been before the court more than once, and had
there been affirmed and re-affirmed through a course of years,
it then might be, perhaps would be, factious, nay, even revolutionary,
not to acquiesce in it as a precedent.</p>

<p>&#8220;But when, as is true, we find it wanting in all these
claims to the public confidence, it is not resistance, it is not
factious, it is not even disrespectful, to treat it as not having
yet quite established a settled doctrine for the country. But
Judge Douglas considers this view awful. Hear him:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;The courts are the tribunals prescribed by the Constitution
and created by the authority of the people to determine,
expound, and enforce the law. Hence, whoever resists the
final decision of the highest judicial tribunal, aims a deadly
blow to our whole Republican system of government&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;a blow
which, if successful, would place all our rights and liberties at
the mercy of passion, anarchy and violence. I repeat, therefore,
that if resistance to the decisions of the Supreme Court
of the United States, in a matter like the points decided in
the Dred Scott case, clearly within their jurisdiction as defined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">436</a></span>
by the Constitution, shall be forced upon the country
as a political issue, it will become a distinct and naked issue
between the friends and enemies of the Constitution&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;the
friends and enemies of the supremacy of the laws.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, this same Supreme Court once decided a national
bank to be Constitutional; but General Jackson, as President
of the United States, disregarded the decision, and vetoed a
bill for a re-charter, partly on Constitutional ground, declaring
that each public functionary must support the Constitution,
&#8216;as he understands it.&#8217; But hear the General&#8217;s own
words. Here they are, taken from his veto message:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;It is maintained by the advocates of the bank, that its
Constitutionality, in all its features, ought to be considered as
settled by precedent, and by the decision of the Supreme
Court. To this conclusion I can not assent. Mere precedent
is a dangerous source of authority, and should not be regarded
as deciding questions of Constitutional power, except where
the acquiescence of the people and the States can be considered
as well settled. So far from this being the case on this
subject, an argument against the bank might be based on
precedent. One Congress, in 1791, decided in favor of a
bank; another, in 1811, decided against it. One Congress,
in 1815, decided against a bank; another, in 1816, decided in
its favor. Prior to the present Congress, therefore, the precedents
drawn from that source were equal. If we resort to
the States, the expression of legislative, judicial, and executive
opinions against the bank have been probably to those
in its favor as four to one. There is nothing in precedent,
therefore, which, if its authority were admitted, ought to
weigh in favor of the act before me.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;I drop the quotations merely to remark, that all there ever
was, in the way of precedent up to the Dred Scott decision,
on the points therein decided, had been against that decision.
But hear General Jackson further:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;If the opinion of the Supreme Court covered the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">437</a></span>
ground of this act, it ought not to control the co-ordinate
authorities of this Government. The Congress, the Executive
and the Court, must each for itself be guided by its own
opinion of the Constitution. Each public officer, who takes
an oath to support the Constitution, swears that he will support
it as he understands it, and not as it is understood by
others.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Again and again have I heard Judge Douglas denounce
that bank decision, and applaud General Jackson for disregarding
it. It would be interesting for him to look over his
recent speech, and see how exactly his fierce philippics against
us for resisting Supreme Court decisions, fall upon his own
head. It will call to mind a long and fierce political war in
this country, upon an issue which, in his own language, and,
of course, in his own changeless estimation, was &#8216;a distinct
issue between the friends and the enemies of the Constitution,&#8217;
and in which war he fought in the ranks of the enemies
of the Constitution.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have said, in substance, that the Dred Scott decision was,
in part, based on assumed historical facts which were not
really true, and I ought not to leave the subject without
giving some reasons for saying this; I, therefore, give an
instance or two, which I think fully sustain me. Chief Justice
Taney, in delivering the opinion of the majority of the
Court, insists at great length, that negroes were no part of
the people who made, or for whom was made, the Declaration
of Independence, or the Constitution of the United
States.</p>

<p>&#8220;On the contrary, Judge Curtis, in his dissenting opinion,
shows that in five of the then thirteen States, to wit: New
Hampshire, Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, and
North Carolina, free negroes were voters, and, in proportion
to their numbers, had the same part in making the Constitution
that the white people had. He shows this with so much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">438</a></span>
particularity as to leave no doubt of its truth; and as a sort
of conclusion on that point, holds the following language:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;The constitution was ordained and established by the
people of the United States, through the action, in each State,
of those persons who were qualified by its laws to act thereon
in behalf of themselves and all other citizens of the State.
In some of the States, as we have seen, colored persons were
among those qualified by law to act on the subject. These
colored persons were not only included in the body of &#8216;the
people of the United States,&#8217; by whom the Constitution was
ordained and established; but in at least five of the States
they had the power to act, and, doubtless, did act, by their
suffrages, upon the question of its adoption.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Again, Chief Justice Taney says: &#8216;It is difficult, at this
day to realize the state of public opinion in relation to that
unfortunate race, which prevailed in the civilized and enlightened
portions of the world at the time of the Declaration of
Independence, and when the Constitution of the United
States was framed and adopted.&#8217; And again, after quoting
from the Declaration, he says: &#8216;The general words above
quoted would seem to include the whole human family, and
if they were used in a similar instrument at this day, would
be so understood.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;In these the Chief Justice does not directly assert, but
plainly assumes, as a fact, that the public estimate of the
black man is more favorable now than it was in the days of
the Revolution. This assumption is a mistake. In some
trifling particulars, the condition of that race has been ameliorated;
but as a whole, in this country, the change between
then and now is decidedly the other way; and their ultimate
destiny has never appeared so hopeless as in the last three or
four years. In two of the five States&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;New Jersey and
North Carolina&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;that then gave the free negro the right of
voting, the right has since been taken away; and in the third&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;New
York&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;it has been greatly abridged; while it has not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">439</a></span>
been extended, so far as I know, to a single additional State,
though the number of the States has more than doubled. In
those days, as I understand, masters could, at their own
pleasure, emancipate their slaves; but since then such legal
restraints have been made upon emancipation as to amount
almost to prohibition. In those days &#8216;Legislatures held the
unquestioned power to abolish slavery in their respective
States; but now it is becoming quite fashionable for State
Constitutions to withhold that power from the Legislatures.
In those days by common consent, the spread of the black
man&#8217;s bondage to the new countries was prohibited; but now,
Congress decides that it will not continue the prohibition&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;and
the Supreme Court decides that it could not if it would.
In those days our Declaration of Independence was held
sacred by all, and thought to include all; but now, to aid in
making the bondage of the negro universal and eternal, it is
assailed, sneered at, construed, hawked at, and torn, till, if its
framers could rise from their graves, they could not at all
recognize it. All the powers of earth seem rapidly combining
against him. Mammon is after him; ambition follows,
philosophy follows, and the theology of the day is fast joining
the cry. They have him in his prison-house; they have
searched his person, and left no prying instrument with him.
One after another they have closed the heavy iron doors upon
him; and now they have him, as it were, bolted in with a
lock of a hundred keys, which can never be unlocked without
the concurrence of every key; the keys in the hands of a hundred
different men, and they scattered to a hundred different
and distant places; and they stand musing as to what invention,
in all the dominions of mind and matter, can be produced
to make the impossibility of his escape more complete
than it is.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is grossly incorrect to say or assume, that the public
estimate of the negro is more favorable now than it was at
the origin of the Government.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">440</a></span>
&#8220;Three years and a half ago, Judge Douglas brought forward
his famous Nebraska bill. The country was at once in
a blaze. He scorned all opposition, and carried it through
Congress. Since then he has seen himself superseded in a
Presidential nomination, by one indorsing the general doctrine
of his measure, but at the same time standing clear of
the odium of its untimely agitation, and its gross breach of
national faith; and he has seen that successful rival Constitutionally
elected, not by the strength of friends, but by the
division of his adversaries, being in a popular minority of
nearly four hundred thousand votes. He has seen his chief
aids in his own State, Shields and Richardson, politely speaking,
successively tried, convicted, and executed, for an offence
not their own, but his. And now he sees his own case,
standing next on the docket for trial.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is a natural disgust, in the minds of nearly all white
people, to the idea of an indiscriminate amalgamation of the
white and black races; and Judge Douglas evidently is basing
his chief hope upon the chances of his being able to appropriate
the benefit of this disgust to himself. If he can, by
much drumming and repeating, fasten the odium of that idea
upon his adversaries, he thinks he can struggle through the
storm. He, therefore, clings to this hope, as a drowning man
to the last plank. He makes an occasion for lugging it in
from the opposition to the Dred Scott decision. He finds the
Republicans insisting that the Declaration of Independence
includes <span class="smcap smaller">ALL</span> men, black as well as white, and forthwith he
boldly denies that it includes negroes at all, and proceeds to
argue gravely that all who contend it does do so only because
they want to vote, eat and sleep, and marry with negroes.
He will have it that they can not be consistent else. Now,
I protest against the counterfeit logic which concludes that
because I do not want a black woman for a slave I must
necessarily want her for a wife. I need not have her for
either. I can just leave her alone. In some respects she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">441</a></span>
certainly is not my equal; but in her natural right to eat the
bread she earns with her own hands, without asking leave of
any one else, she is my equal, and the equal of all others.</p>

<p>&#8220;Chief Justice Taney, in his opinion in the Dred Scott case,
admits that the language of the Declaration is broad enough
to include the whole human family; but he and Judge Douglas
argue that the authors of that instrument did not intend
to include negroes, by the fact that they did not at once actually
place them on an equality with the whites. Now, this
grave argument comes to just nothing at all, by the other
fact, that they did not at once, or ever afterward, actually
place all white people on an equality with one another. And
this is the staple argument of both the Chief Justice and the
Senator for doing this obvious violence to the plain, unmistakable
language of the Declaration.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think the authors of that notable instrument intended
to include <i>all</i> men, but they did not intend to declare all men
equal <i>in all respects</i>. They did not mean to say all were
equal in color, size, intellect, moral developments, or social
capacity. They defined with tolerable distinctness in what
respects they did consider all men created equal&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;equal with
&#8216;certain inalienable rights, among which are life, liberty, and
the pursuit of happiness.&#8217; This they said, and this meant.
They did not mean to assert the obvious untruth, that all
were then actually enjoying that equality, nor yet that they
were about to confer it immediately upon them. In fact,
they had no power to confer such a boon. They meant
simply to declare the <i>right</i>, so that the <i>enforcement</i> of it
might follow as fast as circumstances should permit.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<h3>SPEECH IN REPLY TO SENATOR DOUGLAS.</h3>

<p class="center p1 b1">(<i>At Chicago, on the evening of July 10, 1858.</i>)</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">My Fellow-Citizens</span>: On yesterday evening, upon the
occasion of the reception given to Senator Douglas, I was
furnished with a seat very convenient for hearing him, and
was otherwise very courteously treated by him and his
friends, for which I thank him and them. During the course
of his remarks my name was mentioned in such a way as, I
suppose, renders it at least not improper that I should make
some sort of reply to him. I shall not attempt to follow him
in the precise order in which he addressed the assembled
multitude upon that occasion, though I shall perhaps do so in
the main.</p>

<p>&#8220;There was one question to which he asked the attention
of the crowd, which I deem of somewhat less importance&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;at
least of propriety for me to dwell upon&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;than the others,
which he brought in near the close of his speech, and which
I think it would not be entirely proper for me to omit attending
to, and yet if I were not to give some attention to it now,
I should probably forget it altogether. While I am upon
this subject, allow me to say that I do not intend to indulge
in that inconvenient mode sometimes adopted in public
speaking, of reading from documents; but I shall depart from
that rule so far as to read a little scrap from his speech,
which notices this first topic of which I shall speak&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;that is,
provided I can find it in the paper. [Examines the morning&#8217;s
paper.]</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I have made up my mind to appeal to the people against
the combination that has been made against me! the Republican
leaders having formed an alliance, an unholy and unnatural
alliance, with a portion of unscrupulous federal office-holders.
I intend to fight that allied army wherever I meet
them. I know they deny the alliance, but yet these men who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">443</a></span>
are trying to divide the Democratic party for the purpose of
electing a Republican Senator in my place, are just as much
the agents and tools of the supporters of Mr. Lincoln. Hence
I shall deal with this allied army just as the Russians dealt
with the allies at Sebastopol&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;that is, the Russians did not
stop to inquire, when they fired a broadside, whether it hit
an Englishman, a Frenchman, or a Turk. Nor will I stop to
inquire, nor shall I hesitate, whether my blows shall hit these
Republican leaders or their allies, who are holding the federal
offices and yet acting in concert with them.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, now, gentlemen, is not that very alarming? Just
to think of it! right at the outset of his canvass, I, a poor,
kind, amiable, intelligent gentleman, I am to be slain in this
way. Why, my friends, the Judge, is not only, as it turns
out, not a dead lion, nor even a living one&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;he is the rugged
Russian Bear!</p>

<p>&#8220;But if they will have it&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;for he says that we deny it&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;that
there is any such alliance as he says there is&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;and I
don&#8217;t propose hanging very much upon this question of veracity&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;but
if he will have it that there is such an alliance&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;that
the Administration men and we are allied, and we stand in
the attitude of English, French and Turk, he occupying the
position of the Russian, in that case, I beg that he will indulge
us while we barely suggest to him that these allies took
Sebastopol.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gentlemen, only a few more words as to this alliance. For
my part, I have to say, that whether there be such an alliance,
depends, so far as I know, upon what may be a right definition
of the term <i>alliance</i>. If for the Republican party to
see the other great party to which they are opposed divided
among themselves, and not try to stop the division and rather
be glad of it&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;if that is an alliance, I confess I am in; but if
it is meant to be said that the Republicans had formed an
alliance going beyond that, by which there is contribution of
money or sacrifice of principle on the one side or the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">444</a></span>
so far as the Republican party is concerned, if there be any
such thing, I protest that I neither know any thing of it, nor
do I believe it. I will, however, say&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;as I think this branch
of the argument is lugged in&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;I would, before I leave it,
state, for the benefit of those concerned, that one of those
same Buchanan men did once tell me of an argument that he
made for his opposition to Judge Douglas. He said that a
friend of our Senator Douglas had been talking to him, and
had among other things said to him: &#8216;Why, you don&#8217;t want
to beat Douglas?&#8217; &#8216;Yes,&#8217; said he, &#8216;I do want to beat him,
and I will tell you why. I believe his original Nebraska Bill
was right in the abstract, but it was wrong in the time that it
was brought forward. It was wrong in the application to a
Territory in regard to which the question had been settled;
it was brought forward in a time when nobody asked him; it
was tendered to the South when the South had not asked for
it, but when they could not well refuse it; and for this same
reason he forced that question upon our party; it has sunk
the best men all over the nation, everywhere; and now when
our President, struggling with the difficulties of this man&#8217;s
getting up, has reached the very hardest point to turn in the
case, his deserts him, and I <i>am</i> for putting him where he will
trouble us no more.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, gentlemen, that is not my argument&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;that is not
my argument at all. I have only been stating to you the
argument of a Buchanan man. You will judge if there is
any force in it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Popular sovereignty! everlasting popular sovereignty!
Let us for a moment inquire into this vast matter of popular
sovereignty. What is popular sovereignty? We recollect
that in an early period in the history of this struggle, there
was another name for the same thing&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;<i>Squatter Sovereignty</i>.
It was not exactly Popular Sovereignty, but Squatter Sovereignty.
What do those terms mean? What do those terms
mean when used now? And vast credit is taken by our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">445</a></span>
friend, the Judge, in regard to his support of it, when he
declares the last years of his life have been, and all the future
years of his life shall be, devoted to this matter of popular
sovereignty. What is it? Why it is the sovereignty of the
people! What was Squatter Sovereignty? I suppose if it
had any significance at all it was the right of the people to
govern themselves, to be sovereign in their own affairs while
they were squatted down in a country not their own, while
they had squatted on a Territory that did not belong to them,
in the sense that a State belongs to the people who inhabit
it&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;when it belonged to the nation&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;such right to govern
themselves was called &#8216;Squatter Sovereignty.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now I wish you to mark. What has become of that
Squatter Sovereignty? What has become of it? Can you
get any body to tell you now that the people of a Territory
have any authority to govern themselves, in regard to this
mooted question of slavery, before they form a State Constitution?
No such thing at all, although there is a general
running fire, and although there has been a hurrah made in
every speech on that side, assuming that policy had given
the people of a Territory the right to govern themselves upon
this question; yet the point is dodged. To-day it has been
decided&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;no more than a year ago it was decided by the
Supreme Court of the United States, as is insisted upon to-day,
that the people of a Territory have no right to exclude
slavery from a Territory, that if any one man chooses to take
slaves into a Territory, all of the rest of the people have no
right to keep them out. This being so, and this decision
being made one of the points that the Judge approved, and
one in the approval of which he says he means to keep me
down&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;<i>put</i> me down I should not say, for I have never been
up. He says he is in favor of it, and sticks to it, and expects
to win his battle on that decision, which says that there is no
such thing as Squatter Sovereignty; but that any one man
may take slaves into a Territory, and all the other men in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">446</a></span>
Territory may be opposed to it, and yet by reason of the
Constitution they can not prohibit it. When that is so, how
much is left of this vast matter of Squatter Sovereignty I
should like to know? [A voice&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;&#8216;It is all gone.&#8217;]</p>

<p>&#8220;When we get back, we get to the point of the right of the
people to make a Constitution. Kansas was settled, for
example, in 1854. It was a Territory yet, without having
formed a Constitution, in a very regular way, for three years.
All this time negro slavery could be taken in by any few
individuals, and by that decision of the Supreme Court, which
the Judge approves, all the rest of the people can not keep it
out; but when they come to make a Constitution they may
say they will not have slavery. But it is there; they are
obliged to tolerate it some way, and all experience shows it
will be so&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;for they will not take negro slaves and absolutely
deprive the owners of them. All experience shows
this to be so. All that space of time that runs from the
beginning of the settlement of the Territory until there is
sufficiency of people to make a State Constitution&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;all that
portion of time popular sovereignty is given up. The seal
is absolutely put down upon it by the Court decision, and
Judge Douglas puts his on the top of that, yet he is appealing
to the people to give him vast credit for his devotion to popular
sovereignty.</p>

<p>&#8220;Again, when we get to the question of the right of the
people to form a State Constitution as they please, to form it
with slavery or without slavery&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;if that is any thing new, I
confess I don&#8217;t know it. Has there ever been a time when
any body said that any other than the people of a Territory
itself should form a Constitution? What is now in it that
Judge Douglas should have fought several years of his life,
and pledge himself to fight all the remaining years of his
life for? Can Judge Douglas find any body on earth that
said that any body else should form a Constitution for a
people? [A voice, &#8216;Yes.&#8217;] Well, I should like you to name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">447</a></span>
him; I should like to know who he was. [Same voice,
&#8216;John Calhoun.&#8217;]</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Sir, I never heard of even John Calhoun saying such
a thing. He insisted on the same principle as Judge Douglas;
but his mode of applying it in fact, was wrong. It is enough
for my purpose to ask this crowd, when ever a Republican
said any thing against it? They never said any thing against
it, but they have constantly spoken for it; and whosoever will
undertake to examine the platform, and the speeches of responsible
men of the party, and of irresponsible men, too, if
you please, will be unable to find one word from anybody
in the Republican ranks, opposed to that Popular Sovereignty
which Judge Douglas thinks that he has invented. I suppose
that Judge Douglas will claim in a little while, that he is the
inventor of the idea that the people should govern themselves;
that nobody ever thought of such a thing until he
brought it forward. We do remember, that in that old
Declaration of Independence, it is said that &#8216;We hold these
truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal;
that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable
rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the
pursuit of happiness; that to secure these rights, governments
are instituted among men, deriving their just powers
from the consent of the governed.&#8217; There is the origin of
the Popular Sovereignty. Who, then, shall come in at this
day and claim that he invented it&#8221;?</p></blockquote>

<p>After referring, in appropriate terms, to the credit
claimed by Douglas for defeating the Lecompton policy, Mr.
Lincoln proceeds:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;I defy you to show a printed resolution passed in a Democratic
meeting&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;I take it upon myself to defy any man to
show a printed resolution of a Democratic meeting, large or
small, in favor of Judge Trumbull, or any of the five to one
Republican who beat the bill. Every thing must be for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">448</a></span>
Democrats! They did every thing, and the five to the one
that really did the thing, they snub over, and they do not
seem to remember that they have an existence upon the face
of the earth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gentlemen, I fear that I shall become tedious. I leave
this branch of the subject to take hold of another. I take up
that part of Judge Douglas&#8217;s speech in which he respectfully
attended to me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Judge Douglas made two points upon my recent speech
at Springfield. He says they are to be the issues of this campaign.
The first one of these points he bases upon the language
in a speech which I delivered at Springfield, which I
believe I can quote correctly from memory. I said there that
&#8216;we are now far on in the fifth year since a policy was instituted
for the avowed object, and with the confident promise
of putting an end to slavery agitation; under the operation
of that policy, that agitation had not only not ceased, but
had constantly augmented. I believe it will not cease until a
crisis shall have been reached and passed. A house divided
against itself can not stand. I believe this Government can
not endure permanently half slave and half free. I do not
expect the Union to be dissolved&#8217;&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;I am quoting from my
speech&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;&#8216;I do not expect the house to fall, but I do expect it
will cease to be divided. It will come all one thing or the
other. Either the opponents of slavery will arrest the spread
of it, and place it where the public mind shall rest in the
belief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction, or its advocates
will push it forward until it shall have become alike
lawful in all the States, North as well as South.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;In this paragraph which I have quoted in your hearing,
and to which I ask the attention of all, Judge Douglas thinks
he discovers great political heresy. I want your attention
particularly to what he has inferred from it. He says I am
in favor of making all the States of this Union uniform in all
their internal regulations; that in all their domestic concerns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">449</a></span>
I am in favor of making them entirely uniform. He draws
this inference from the language I have quoted to you. He
says that I am in favor of making war by the North upon the
South for the extinction of slavery; that I am also in favor
of inviting, as he expresses it, the South to a war upon the
North, for the purpose of nationalizing slavery. Now, it is
singular enough, if you will carefully read that passage over,
that I did not say that I was in favor of any thing in it. I
only said what I expected would take place. I made a prediction
only&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;it may have been a foolish one perhaps. I did
not even say that I desired that slavery should be put in
course of ultimate extinction. I do say so now, however, so
there need be no longer any difficulty about that. It may be
written down in the next speech.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gentlemen, Judge Douglas informed you that this speech
of mine was probably carefully prepared. I admit that it
was. I am not master of language; I have not a fine education;
I am not capable of entering into a disquisition upon
dialects, as I believe you call it; but I do not believe the language
I employed bears any such construction as Judge
Douglas puts upon it. But I don&#8217;t care about a quibble in
regard to words. I know what I meant, and I will not
leave this crowd in doubt, if I can explain it to them, what
I really meant in the use of that paragraph.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not, in the first place, unaware that this Government
has endured eighty-two years, half slave and half free.
I know that. I am tolerably well acquainted with the history
of the country, and I know that it has endured eighty-two
years, half slave and half free. I <i>believe</i>&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;and that is what I
meant to allude to there&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;I <i>believe</i> it has endured, because
during all that time, until the introduction of the Nebraska
bill, the public mind did rest all the time in the belief that
slavery was in course of ultimate extinction. That was what
gave us the rest that we had through that period of eighty-two
years; at least, so I believe. I have always hated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">450</a></span>
slavery, I think, as much as any Abolitionist. I have been
an Old Line Whig. I have always hated it, but I have
always been quiet about it until this new era of the introduction
of the Nebraska Bill began. I always believed that
everybody was against it, and that it was in course of ultimate
extinction. [Pointing to Mr. Browning, who stood near by:]
Browning thought so; the great mass of the Nation have
rested in the belief that slavery was in the course of ultimate
extinction. They had reason so to believe.</p>

<p>&#8220;The adoption of the Constitution and its attendant history
led the people to believe so; and that such was the belief of
the framers of the Constitution itself. Why did those old
men, about the time of the adoption of the Constitution,
decree that slavery should not go into the new territory,
where it had not already gone? Why declare that within
twenty years the African slave-trade, by which slaves are
supplied, might be cut off by Congress? Why were all these
acts? I might enumerate more of such acts&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;but enough.
What were they but a clear indication that the framers of the
Constitution intended and expected the ultimate extinction of
that institution? And now, when I say, as I said in this
speech that Judge Douglas has quoted from, when I say that
I think the opponents of slavery will resist the further spread
of it, and place it where the public mind shall rest with the
belief that it is in course of ultimate extinction, I only mean
to say, that they will place it where the founders of this
Government originally placed it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have said a hundred times, and I have no inclination to
take it back, that I believe there is no right, and ought to be
no inclination in the people of the free States to enter into
the slave States, and to interfere with the question of slavery
at all. I have said that always. Judge Douglas has heard
me say it&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;if not quite a hundred times, at least as good as a
hundred times; and when it is said that I am in favor of
interfering with slavery where it exists, I know that it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">451</a></span>
unwarranted by any thing I have ever intended, and, as I
believe, by any thing I have ever said. If, by any means, I
have ever used language which could fairly be so construed
(as, however, I believe I never have), I now correct it.</p>

<p>&#8220;So much, then, for the inference that Judge Douglas
draws, that I am in favor of setting the sections at war with
one another. I know that I never meant any such thing, and
I believe that no fair mind can infer any such thing from any
thing I have ever said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now in relation to his inference that I am in favor of a
general consolidation of all the local institutions of the various
States. I will attend to that for a little while, and try to
inquire, if I can, how on earth it could be that any man could
draw such an inference from any thing I said. I have said,
very many times, in Judge Douglas&#8217;s hearing, that no man
believed more than I in the principle of self-government;
that it lies at the bottom of all my ideas of just government,
from beginning to end. I have denied that his use of that
term applies properly. But for the thing itself, I deny that
any man has ever gone ahead of me in his devotion to the
principle, whatever he may have done in efficiency in advocating
it. I think that I have said it in your hearing&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;that I
believe each individual is naturally entitled to do as he pleases
with himself and with the fruit of his labor, so far as it in no
wise interferes with any other man&#8217;s rights&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;that each community,
as a State, has a right to do exactly as it pleases
with all the concerns within that State that interfere with the
right of no other State, and that the General Government,
upon principle, has no right to interfere with any thing other
than that general class of things that does concern the whole.
I have said that at all times. I have said as illustrations,
that I do not believe in the right of Illinois to interfere with
the cranberry laws of Indiana, the oyster laws of Virginia, or
the liquor laws of Maine. I have said these things over and
over again, and I repeat them here as my sentiments....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">452</a></span>
&#8220;So much then as to my disposition&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;my wish&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;to have
all the State Legislatures blotted out, and to have one consolidated
government, and a uniformity of domestic regulations
in all the States; by which I suppose it is meant, if we
raise corn here, we must make sugar-cane grow here too, and
we must make those which grow North grow in the South.
All this I suppose he understands I am in favor of doing.
Now, so much for all this nonsense&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;for I must call it so.
The Judge can have no issue with me on a question of established
uniformity in the domestic regulations of the States.</p>

<p>&#8220;A little now on the other point&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;the Dred Scott decision.
Another of the issues he says that is to be made with me, is
upon his devotion to the Dred Scott decision, and my opposition
to it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have expressed heretofore, and I now repeat my opposition
to the Dred Scott decision, but I should be allowed to
state the nature of that opposition, and I ask your indulgence
while I do so. What is fairly implied by the term Judge
Douglas has used, &#8216;resistance to the decision?&#8217; I do not
resist it. If I wanted to take Dred Scott from his master, I
would be interfering with property, and that terrible difficulty
that Judge Douglas speaks of, of interfering with property
would arise. But I am doing no such thing as that, but
all that I am doing is refusing to obey it as a political rule.
If I were in Congress, and a vote should come up on a
question whether slavery should be prohibited in a new Territory,
in spite of the Dred Scott decision, I would vote that
it should.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is what I would do. Judge Douglas said last
night, that before the decision he might advance his opinion,
and it might be contrary to the decision when it was made;
but <i>after</i> it was made he would abide by it until it was reversed.
Just so! We let this property abide by the decision,
but we will try to reverse that decision. [Loud applause.]
We will try to put it where Judge Douglas will not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">453</a></span>
object, for he says he will obey it until it is reversed. Some
body has to reverse that decision, since it was made, and we
mean to reverse it, and we mean to do it peaceably.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are the uses of decisions of courts? They have
two uses. As rules of property they have two uses. First&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;they
decide upon the question before the court. They decide
in this case that Dred Scott is a slave. Nobody resists that.
Not only that, but they say to everybody else, that persons
standing just as Dred Scott stands, is as he is. That is, they
say that when a question comes up upon another person, it
will be so decided again unless the court decides in another
way, unless the court overrules its decision. Well, we mean
to do what we can to have the court decide the other way.
That is one thing we mean to try to do.</p>

<p>&#8220;The sacredness that Judge Douglas throws around this
decision, is a degree of sacredness that has never been before
thrown around any other decision. I have never heard of
such a thing. Why, decisions apparently contrary to that
decision, or that good lawyers thought were contrary to that
decision, have been made by that very court before. It is
the first of the kind; it is an <i>astonisher</i> in legal history. It is
a new wonder of the world. It is based upon falsehoods in
the main as to the facts&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;allegation of facts upon which it
stands are not facts at all in many instances, and no decision
made on any question&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;the first instance of a decision made
under so many unfavorable circumstances&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;thus placed, has
ever been held by the profession as law, and it has always
needed confirmation before the lawyers regarded it as settled
law. But Judge Douglas will have it that all hands must
take this extraordinary decision, made under these extraordinary
circumstances, and give their vote in Congress in accordance
with it, yield to it and obey it in every possible
sense. Circumstances alter cases. Do not gentlemen here
remember the case of that same Supreme Court, twenty-five
or thirty years ago, deciding that a National Bank was Constitutional?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">454</a></span>
I ask, if somebody does not remember that a
National Bank was declared to be Constitutional? Such is
the truth, whether it be remembered or not. The Bank
charter ran out, and a re-charter was granted by Congress.
That re-charter was laid before General Jackson. It was
urged upon him, when he denied the Constitutionality of the
Bank, that the Supreme Court had decided that it was Constitutional;
and that General Jackson then said that the
Supreme Court had no right to lay down a rule to govern a
co-ordinate branch of the Government, the members of which
had sworn to support the Constitution&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;that each member
had sworn to support that Constitution as he understood it.
I will venture here to say, that I have heard Judge Douglas
say that he approved of General Jackson for that act.
What has now become of all his tirade about &#8216;resistance to
the Supreme Court?&#8217; * * *</p>

<p>&#8220;We were often&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;more than once, at least&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;in the course
of Judge Douglas&#8217;s speech last night, reminded that this
Government was made for white men&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;that he believed it
was made for white men. Well, that is putting it into
a shape in which no one wants to deny it; but the Judge
then goes into his passion for drawing inferences that are not
warranted. I protest, now, and forever, against that counterfeit
logic which presumes that because I did not want a negro
woman for a slave, I do necessarily want her for a wife. My
understanding is that I need not have her for either; but, as
God made us separate, we can leave one another alone, and
do one another much good thereby. There are white men
enough to marry all the white women, and enough black men
to marry all the black women, and in God&#8217;s name let them
be so married. The Judge regales us with the terrible
enormities that take place by the mixture of races; that is the
inferior race bears the superior down. Why, Judge, if you
do not let them get together in the Territories they won&#8217;t mix
there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">455</a></span>
&#8220;Now, it happens that we meet together once every year,
some time about the Fourth of July, for some reason or other.
These Fourth of July gatherings I suppose have their uses.
If you will indulge me, I will state what I suppose to be some
of them.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are now a mighty nation; we are thirty, or about
thirty millions of people, and we own and inhabit about one-fifteenth
part of the dry land of the whole earth. We run
our memory back over the pages of history for about eighty-two
years, and we discover that we were then a very small
people in point of numbers, vastly inferior to what we are
now, with a vastly less extent of country, with vastly less of
every thing we deem desirable among men&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;we look upon
the change as exceedingly advantageous to us and to our
posterity, and we fix upon something that happened away
back, as in some way or other being connected with this rise
of posterity. We find a race of men living in that day whom
we claim as our fathers and grandfathers; they were iron
men; they fought for the principle that they were contending
for; and we understood that by what they then did it has
followed that the degree of prosperity which we now enjoy
has come to us. We hold this annual celebration to remind
ourselves of all the good done in this process of time, of how
it was done and who did it, and how we are historically connected
with it; and we go from these meetings in better
humor with ourselves&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;we feel more attached the one to the
other, and more firmly bound to the country we inhabit. In
every way we are better men in the age, and race, and country
in which we live, for these celebrations. But after we have
done all this, we have not yet reached the whole. There is
something else connected with it. We have, besides these&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;men
descended by blood from our ancestors&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;those among us
perhaps, half our people, who are not descendants at all of
these men; they are men who have come from Europe&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;German,
Irish, French, and Scandinavian&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;men that have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">456</a></span>
come from Europe themselves, or whose ancestors have come
hither and settled here, finding themselves our equals in all
things. If they look back through this history to trace their
connection with those days by blood, they find they have
none; they cannot carry themselves back into that glorious
epoch and make themselves feel that they are part of us; but
when they look through that old Declaration of Independence,
they find that those old men say that &#8216;we hold these truths
to be self-evident, that all men are created equal,&#8217; and then
they feel that that moral sentiment, taught on that day, evidences
their relation to those men, that it is the father of all
moral principle in them, and that they have a right to claim
it as though they were blood of the blood and flesh of the
flesh of the men who wrote that Declaration, and so they are.
That is the electric cord in that Declaration that links the
hearts of patriotic and liberty-loving men together, that will
link those patriotic hearts as long as the love of freedom
exists in the minds of men throughout the world.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, sirs, for the purpose of squaring things with this
idea of &#8216;don&#8217;t care if slavery is voted up or voted down,&#8217; for
sustaining the Dred Scott decision, for holding that the Declaration
of Independence did not mean any thing at all, we have
Judge Douglas giving his exposition of what the Declaration
of Independence means, and we have him saying that the
people of America are equal to the people of England. According
to his construction, you Germans are not connected
with it. Now I ask you in all soberness, if all these things,
if indulged in, if ratified, if confirmed and indorsed, if taught
to our children and repeated to them, do not tend to rub out
the sentiment of liberty in the country, and to transform this
Government into a government of some other form. These
arguments that are made, that the inferior race are to be
treated with as much allowance as they are capable of enjoying;
that as much is to be done for them as their condition
will allow&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;what are these arguments? They are the arguments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">457</a></span>
that Kings have made for enslaving the people in all
ages of the world. You will find that all the arguments in
favor of King-craft were of this class; they always bestrode
the necks of the people, not that they wanted to do it, but
because the people were better off for being ridden. That is
their argument, and this argument of the Judge is the same
old serpent that says: You work, and I eat, you toil and I
will enjoy the fruits of it. Turn it whatever way you will&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;whether
it come from the mouth of a King, an excuse for
enslaving the people of his country, or from the mouth of
men of one race as a reason for enslaving the men of another
race, it is all the same old serpent, and I hold if that course
of argumentation that is made for the purpose of convincing
the public mind that we should not care about this, should be
granted, it does not stop with the negro. I should like to
know if, taking this old Declaration of Independence, which
declares that all men are equal upon principle, you begin
making exceptions to it, where you will stop? If one man
says it does not mean a negro, why not another say it does
not mean some other man? If that declaration is not the
truth, let us get the statute book, in which we find it, and
tear it out! Who is so bold as to do it? If it is not true,
let us tear it out! [cries of &#8216;no, no,&#8217;]; let us stick to it then;
let us stand firmly by it then.</p>

<p>&#8220;It may be argued that there are certain conditions that
make necessities and impose them upon us, and to the extent
that a necessity is imposed upon a man, he must submit to it.
I think that was the condition in which we found ourselves
when we established this Government. We had slaves among
us; we could not get our Constitution unless we permitted
them to remain in slavery; we could not secure the good we
did secure if we grasped for more; and having, by necessity,
submitted to that much, it does not destroy the principle that
is the charter of our liberties. Let that charter stand as our
standard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">458</a></span>
&#8220;My friend has said to me that I am a poor hand to quote
Scripture. I will try it again, however. It is said in one of
the admonitions of our Lord: &#8216;As your Father in heaven is
perfect, be ye also perfect.&#8217; The Saviour, I suppose, did not
expect that any human creature could be perfect as the Father
in Heaven; but He said: &#8216;As your Father in Heaven is perfect,
be ye also perfect.&#8217; He set that up as a standard, and
he who did most toward reaching that standard, attained the
highest degree of moral perfection. So I say in relation to
the principle that all men are created equal, let it be as nearly
reached as we can. If we cannot give freedom to every creature,
let us do nothing that will impose slavery upon any
other creature. Let us then turn this Government back into
the channel in which the framers of the Constitution originally
placed it. Let us stand firmly by each other. If we
do not do so we are turning in the contrary direction, that
our friend Judge Douglas proposes&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;not intentionally&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;as
working in the traces tends to make this one universal slave
nation. He is one that runs in that direction, and as such I
resist him.</p>

<p>&#8220;My friends, I have detained you about as long as I desired
to do, and I have only to say, let us discard all this
quibbling about this man and the other man&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;this race and
that race and the other race being inferior, and therefore they
must be placed in an inferior position&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;discarding our standard
that we have left us. Let us discard all these things,
and unite as one people throughout this land, until we shall
once more stand up declaring that all men are created equal.</p>

<p>&#8220;My friends, I could not, without launching off upon some
new topic, which would detain you too long, continue to-night.
I thank you for this most extensive audience that you have
furnished me to-night. I leave you, hoping that the lamp of
liberty will burn in your bosoms until there shall no longer
be a doubt that all men are created free and equal.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<h3>OPENING PASSAGES OF HIS SPEECH AT FREEPORT.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Ladies and Gentlemen</span>:&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;On Saturday last, Judge
Douglas and myself first met in public discussion. He spoke
one hour, I an hour and a half, and he replied for half an
hour. The order is now reversed. I am to speak an hour,
he an hour and a half, and then I am to reply for half an
hour. I propose to devote myself during the first hour to
the scope of what was brought within the range of his half-hour
speech at Ottawa. Of course there was brought within
the scope of that half-hour&#8217;s speech something of his own
opening speech. In the course of that opening argument
Judge Douglas proposed to me seven distinct interrogatories.
In my speech of an hour and a half, I attended to some other
parts of his speech, and incidentally, as I thought, answered
one of the interrogatories then. I then distinctly intimated
to him that I would answer the rest of his interrogatories on
condition only that he should agree to answer as many for
me. He made no intimation at the time of the proposition,
nor did he in his reply allude at all to that suggestion of mine.
I do him no injustice in saying that he occupied at least half
of his reply in dealing with me as though I had <i>refused</i> to
answer his interrogatories. I now propose that I will answer
any of the interrogatories, upon condition that he will answer
questions from me not exceeding the same number. I give
him an opportunity to respond. The judge remains silent.
I now say that I will answer his interrogatories, whether he
answers mine or not; and that after I have done so, I shall
propound mine to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have supposed myself, since the organization of the
Republican party at Bloomington, in May, 1856, bound as a
party man by the platforms of the party, then and since. If
in any interrogatories which I shall answer, I go beyond the
scope of what is within these platforms, it will be perceived
that no one is responsible but myself.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">460</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;Having said thus much, I will take up the judge&#8217;s interrogatories
as I find them printed in the Chicago <i>Times</i>, and
answer them <i>seriatim</i>. In order that there may be no mistake
about it, I have copied the interrogatories in writing,
and also my answers to them. The first one of these interrogatories
is in these words:</p>

<p>Question 1. &#8220;&#8216;I desire to know whether Lincoln to-day
stands, as he did in 1854, in favor of the unconditional repeal
of the Fugitive Slave law?&#8217;</p>

<p>Answer. &#8220;I do not now, nor ever did, stand in favor of
the unconditional repeal of the Fugitive Slave law.</p>

<p>Q. 2. &#8220;&#8216;I desire him to answer whether he stands pledged
to-day, as he did in 1854, against the admission of any more
slave States into the Union, even if the people want them?&#8217;</p>

<p>A. &#8220;I do not now, nor ever did, stand pledged against the
admission of any more slave States into the Union.</p>

<p>Q. 3. &#8220;&#8216;I want to know whether he stands pledged against
the admission of a new State into the Union with such a Constitution
as the people of that State may see fit to make?&#8217;</p>

<p>A. &#8220;I do not stand pledged against the admission of a new
State into the Union, with such a Constitution as the people
of that State may see fit to make.</p>

<p>Q. 4. &#8220;&#8216;I want to know whether he stands to-day pledged
to the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia?&#8217;</p>

<p>A. &#8220;I do not stand to-day pledged to the abolition of
slavery in the District of Columbia.</p>

<p>Q. 5. &#8220;&#8216;I desire him to answer whether he stands pledged
to the prohibition of the slave-trade between the different
States?&#8217;</p>

<p>A. &#8220;I do not stand pledged to the prohibition of the slave-trade
between the different States.</p>

<p>Q. 6. &#8220;&#8216;I desire to know whether he stands pledged to
prohibit slavery in all the Territories of the United States,
North as well as South of the Missouri Compromise line?&#8217;</p>

<p>A. &#8220;I am impliedly, if not expressly, pledged to a belief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">461</a></span>
in the <i>right</i> and <i>duty</i> of Congress to prohibit slavery in all
the United States Territories.</p>

<p>Q. 7. &#8220;&#8216;I desire him to answer whether he is opposed to
the acquisition of any new territory unless slavery is first prohibited
therein?&#8217;</p>

<p>A. &#8220;I am not generally opposed to honest acquisition of
territory; and, in any given case, I would or would not
oppose such acquisition, accordingly as I might think such
acquisition would or would not agitate the slavery question
among ourselves.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, my friends, it will be perceived upon an examination
of these questions and answers, that so far I have only
answered that I was not <i>pledged</i> to this, that or the other.
The judge has not framed his interrogatories to ask me any
thing more than this, and I have answered in strict accordance
with the interrogatories, and have answered truly that
I am not <i>pledged</i> at all upon any of the points to which I
have answered. But I am not disposed to hang upon the
exact form of his interrogatory. I am rather disposed to take
up at least some of these questions, and state what I really
think upon them.</p>

<p>&#8220;As to the first one, in regard to the Fugitive Slave law, I
have never hesitated to say, and I do not now hesitate to say,
that I think, under the Constitution of the United States, the
people of the Southern States are entitled to a Congressional
Slave law. Having said that, I have had nothing to say in
regard to the existing Fugitive Slave law, further than that I
think it should have been framed so as to be free from some
of the objections that pertain to it, without lessening its
efficiency. And inasmuch as we are not now in an agitation
in regard to an alteration or modification of that law, I would
not be the man to introduce it as a new subject of agitation
upon the general question of slavery.</p>

<p>&#8220;In regard to the other question, of whether I am pledged
to the admission of any more Slave States into the Union, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">462</a></span>
state to you very frankly that I would be exceedingly sorry
ever to be put in a position of having to pass upon that question.
I should be exceedingly glad to know that there would
never be another slave State admitted into the Union; but
I must add, that if slavery shall be kept out of the Territories
during the Territorial existence of any one given Territory,
and then the people shall, having a fair chance and a clear
field, when they come to adopt the Constitution, do such an
extraordinary thing as to adopt a slave Constitution, uninfluenced
by the actual presence of the institution among them,
I see no alternative if we own the country, but to admit them
into the Union.</p>

<p>&#8220;The third interrogatory is answered by the answer to the
second, it being, as I conceive, the same as the second.</p>

<p>&#8220;The fourth one is in regard to the abolition of slavery in
the District of Columbia. In relation to that, I have my mind
very distinctly made up. I should be exceedingly glad to see
slavery abolished in the District of Columbia. I believe that
Congress possesses the constitutional power to abolish it.
Yet as a member of Congress, I should not with my present
views, be in favor of <i>endeavoring</i> to abolish slavery in the
District of Columbia, unless it would be upon these conditions:
<i>First</i>, that the abolition should be gradual; <i>second</i>, that it
should be on a vote of the majority of qualified voters in the
District; and <i>third</i>, that compensation should be made to
unwilling owners. With these three conditions, I confess I
would be exceedingly glad to see Congress abolish slavery in
the District of Columbia, and, in the language of Henry
Clay, &#8216;sweep from our Capital that foul blot upon our
nation.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;In regard to the fifth interrogatory, I must say here, that
as to the question of the abolition of the slave-trade between
the different States, I can truly answer, as I have, that I am
<i>pledged</i> to nothing about it. It is a subject to which I have
not given that mature consideration that would make me feel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">463</a></span>
authorized to state a position so as to hold myself entirely
bound by it. In other words, that question has never been
prominently enough before me to induce me to investigate
whether we really have the Constitutional power to do it. I
could investigate it if I had sufficient time to bring myself to
a conclusion upon that subject; but I have not done so, and
I say so frankly to you here, and to Judge Douglas. I must
say, however, that if I should be of opinion that Congress
does possess the Constitutional power to abolish slave-trading
among the different States, I should still not be in favor
of the exercise of that power unless upon some conservative
principle as I conceive it, akin to what I have said in relation
to the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia.</p>

<p>&#8220;My answer as to whether I desire that slavery should be
prohibited in all Territories of the United States, is full and
explicit within itself, and can not be made clearer by any
comments of mine. So I suppose in regard to the question
whether I am opposed to the acquisition of any more territory
unless slavery is first prohibited therein, my answer is such
that I could add nothing by way of illustration, or making
myself better understood, than the answer which I have
placed in writing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now in all this, the judge has me, and he has me on the
record. I suppose he had flattered himself that I was really
entertaining one set of opinions for one place and another set
for another place&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;that I was afraid to say at one place what
I uttered at another. What I am saying here I suppose I
say to a vast audience as strongly tending to Abolitionism as
any audience in the State of Illinois, and I believe I am
saying that which, if it would be offensive to any persons
and render them enemies to myself, would be offensive to
persons in this audience.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<h3>LETTER TO GENERAL McCLELLAN.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p class="sigright">

&#8220;<span class="smcap">Washington</span>, April 9, 1862.<br />
</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">My Dear Sir</span>: Your dispatches, complaining that you are
not properly sustained, while they do not offend me, do pain
me very much.</p>

<p>&#8220;Blenker&#8217;s division was withdrawn from you before you left
here, and you know the pressure under which I did it, and, as
I thought, acquiesced in it&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;certainly not without reluctance.</p>

<p>&#8220;After you left, I ascertained that less than twenty thousand
unorganized men, without a single field battery, were
all you designed to be left for the defence of Washington and
Manassas Junction, and part of this even was to go to Gen.
Hooker&#8217;s old position. General Banks&#8217; corps, once designated
for Manassas Junction, was diverted and tied up on the line
of Winchester and Strasburgh, and could not leave it without
again exposing the Upper Potomac and the Baltimore and
Ohio Railroad. This presented, or would present, when
McDowell and Sumner should be gone, a great temptation to
the enemy to turn back from the Rappahannock and sack
Washington. My explicit order that Washington should, by
the judgment of all the commanders of army corps, be
left entirely secure, had been neglected. It was precisely
this that drove me to detain McDowell.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not forget that I was satisfied with your arrangement
to leave Banks at Manassas Junction: but when that arrangement
was broken up, and nothing was substituted for it, of
course I was constrained to substitute something for it myself.
And allow me to ask, do you really think I should permit
the line from Richmond, <i>via</i> Manassas Junction, to this city,
to be entirely open, except what resistance could be presented
by less than twenty thousand unorganized troops? This is
a question which the country will not allow me to evade.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">465</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;There is a curious mystery about the number of troops
now with you. When I telegraphed you on the 6th, saying
you had over a hundred thousand with you, I had just obtained
from the Secretary of War a statement taken, as he said, from
your own returns, making one hundred and eight thousand
then with you and <i>en route</i> to you. You say you will have
but eighty-five thousand when all <i>en route</i> to you shall have
reached you. How can the discrepancy of twenty-three
thousand be accounted for?</p>

<p>&#8220;As to General Wool&#8217;s command, I understand it is doing
for you precisely what a like number of your own would have
to do if that command was away.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose the whole force which has gone forward for
you is with you by this time. And if so, I think it is the
precise time for you to strike a blow. By delay, the enemy
will relatively gain upon you&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;that is, he will gain faster by
fortifications and reinforcement than you can by reinforcements
alone. And once more let me tell you, it is indispensable
to you that you strike a blow. I am powerless to help
this. You will do me the justice to remember I always insisted
that going down the bay in search of a field, instead of
fighting at or near Manassas, was only shifting, and not surmounting
a difficulty; that we would find the same enemy,
and the same or equal intrenchments, at either place. The
country will not fail to note, is now noting, that the present
hesitation to move upon an intrenched enemy is but the story
of Manassas repeated.</p>

<p>&#8220;I beg to assure you that I have never written you or
spoken to you in greater kindness of feeling than now, nor
with a fuller purpose to sustain you, so far as, in my most
anxious judgment, I consistently can. But you must act.</p>

<p class="sigright b0">
<span class="l2">&#8220;Yours, very truly,</span><br />
&#8220;<span class="smcap">A. Lincoln</span>.</p>

<h3>LETTER TO GEN. SCHOFIELD RELATIVE TO THE REMOVAL OF
GEN. CURTIS.</h3>

<blockquote>
<p class="sigright">
&#8220;<i>Executive Mansion</i>, Washington, May 27, 1863.<br />
</p>

<p>&#8220;Gen. <span class="smcap">J.&nbsp;M. Schofield</span>&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;<i>Dear Sir</i>: Having removed
Gen. Curtis and assigned you to the command of the Department
of the Missouri, I think it may be of some advantage to
me to state to you why I did it. I did not remove Gen.
Curtis because of my full conviction that he had done wrong
by commission or omission. I did it because of a conviction
in my mind that the Union men of Missouri, constituting,
when united, a vast majority of the people, have entered into
a pestilent, factious quarrel among themselves, Gen. Curtis,
perhaps not of choice, being the head of one faction, and
Gov. Gamble that of the other. After months of labor to reconcile
the difficulty, it seemed to grow worse and worse,
until I felt it my duty to break it up somehow, and as I
could not remove Gov. Gamble, I had to remove Gen. Curtis.
Now that you are in the position, I wish you to undo nothing
merely because Gen. Curtis or Gov. Gamble did it, but to
exercise your own judgment, and do right for the public interest.
Let your military measures be strong enough to
repel the invaders and keep the peace, and not so strong as
to unnecessarily harass and persecute the people. It is a
difficult <i>role</i>, and so much more will be the honor if you perform
it well. If both factions, or neither, shall abuse you,
you will probably be about right. Beware of being assailed
by one and praised by the other.</p>

<p class="in4">
&#8220;Yours, truly,      <span class="right"><span class="smcap">A. Lincoln</span>.&#8221;</span><br />

<h3>THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND MEN CALLED FOR.</h3>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Whereas</span>, The term of service of part of the volunteer
forces of the United States will expire during the coming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">467</a></span>
year; and <i>whereas</i>, in addition to the men raised by the
present draft, it is deemed expedient to call out three hundred
thousand volunteers, to serve for three years or the war&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;not,
however, exceeding three years.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the
United States and Commander-in-Chief of the Army and
Navy thereof, and of the militia of the several States when
called into actual service, do issue this my proclamation,
calling upon the Governors of the different States to raise and
have enlisted into the United States service, for the various
companies and regiments in the field from their respective
States, their quotas of three hundred thousand men.</p>

<p>&#8220;I further proclaim that all the volunteers thus called out
and duly enlisted shall receive advance pay, premium and
bounty, as heretofore communicated to the Governors of
States by the War Department, through the Provost-Marshal
General&#8217;s office, by special letters.</p>

<p>&#8220;I further proclaim that all volunteers received under this
call, as well as all others not heretofore credited, shall be duly
credited and deducted from the quotas established for the
next draft.</p>

<p>&#8220;I further proclaim that, if any State shall fail to raise the
quota assigned to it by the War Department under this call;
then a draft for the deficiency in said quota shall be made in
said State, or on the districts of said State, for their due proportion
of said quota, and the said draft shall commence on
the fifth day of January, 1864.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I further proclaim that nothing in this proclamation
shall interfere with existing orders, or with those which may
be issued for the present draft in the States where it is now
in progress or where it has not yet been commenced.</p>

<p>&#8220;The quotas of the States and districts will be assigned by
the War Department, through the Provost-Marshal General&#8217;s
office, due regard being had for the men heretofore furnished,
whether by volunteering or drafting, and the recruiting will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">468</a></span>
be conducted in accordance with such instructions as have
been or may be issued by that department.</p>

<p>&#8220;In issuing this proclamation I address myself not only to
the Governors of the several States, but also to the good and
loyal people thereof, invoking them to lend their cheerful,
willing and effective aid to the measures thus adopted, with a
view to reinforce our victorious armies now in the field and
bring our needful military operations to a prosperous end,
thus closing forever the fountains of sedition and civil war.</p>

<p>&#8220;In witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand and
caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.</p>

October, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred

<h3>REV. DR. M&#8217;PHEETERS&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;THE PRESIDENT&#8217;S REPLY TO AN
APPEAL FOR INTERFERENCE.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p class="sigright">

&#8220;<i>Executive Mansion</i>, Washington, December 23, 1863.<br />
</p>

<p>&#8220;I have just looked over a petition signed by some three
dozen citizens of St. Louis, and their accompanying letters,
one by yourself, one by a Mr. Nathan Ranney, and one by a
Mr. John D. Coalter, the whole relating to the Rev. Dr.
McPheeters. The petition prays, in the name of justice and
mercy, that I will restore Dr. McPheeters to all his ecclesiastical
rights.</p>

<p>&#8220;This gives no intimation as to what ecclesiastical rights
are withdrawn. Your letter states that Provost Marshal
Dick, about a year ago, ordered the arrest of Dr. McPheeters,
pastor of the Vine-street Church, prohibited him from officiating,
and placed the management of affairs of the church out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">469</a></span>
of the control of the chosen trustees; and near the close you
state that a certain course &#8216;would insure his release.&#8217; Mr.
Ranney&#8217;s letter says: &#8216;Dr. Samuel McPheeters is enjoying
all the rights of a civilian, but can not preach the gospel!&#8217;
Mr. Coalter, in his letter, asks: &#8216;Is it not a strange illustration
of the condition of things, that the question who shall be
allowed to preach in a church in St. Louis shall be decided by
the President of the United States?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, all this sounds very strangely; and, withal, a little
as if you gentlemen making the application do not understand
the case alike&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;one affirming that this doctor is enjoying all
the rights of a civilian, and another pointing out to me what
will secure his <i>release</i>! On the second of January last, I
wrote to Gen. Curtis in relation to Mr. Dick&#8217;s order upon Dr.
McPheeters; and, as I suppose the Doctor is enjoying all the
rights of a civilian, I only quote that part of the letter which
relates to the church. It was as follows: &#8216;But I must add
that the United States Government must not, as by this order,
undertake to run the churches. When an individual, in a
church or out of it, becomes dangerous to the public interest,
he must be checked; but the churches, as such, must take
care of themselves. It will not do for the United States to
appoint trustees, supervisors, or other agents for the churches.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;This letter going to Gen. Curtis, then in command, I
supposed, of course, it was obeyed, especially as I heard no
further complaint from Dr. Mc. or his friends for nearly an
entire year. I have never interfered, nor thought of interfering,
as to who shall or shall not preach in any church; nor
have I knowingly or believingly tolerated any one else to
interfere by my authority. If any one is so interfering by
color of my authority, I would like to have it specifically
made known to me.</p>

<p>&#8220;If, after all, what is now sought is to have me put Dr.
Mc. back over the heads of a majority of his own congregation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">470</a></span>
that, too, will be declined. I will not have control of
any church on any side.&#8221;</p>

<h3>AN ELECTION ORDERED IN THE STATE OF ARKANSAS.</h3>

the Constitution is so modified as to declare that there shall

<p>Later, the President wrote the following letter:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">William Fishback, Esq.</span>: When I fixed a plan for an
election in Arkansas, I did it in ignorance that your Convention
was at the same work. Since I learned the latter fact, I
have been constantly trying to yield my plan to theirs. I
have sent two letters to Gen. Steele, and three or four dispatches
to you and others, saying that he (Gen. Steele) must
be master, but that it will probably be best for him to keep
the Convention on its own plan. Some single mind must be
master, else there will be no agreement on anything; and
Gen. Steele, commanding the military, and being on the
ground, is the best man to be that master. Even now citizens
are telegraphing me to postpone the election to a later day
than either fixed by the Convention or me. This discord
must be silenced.</p>

<h3>CALL FOR FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND MEN.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Whereas</span>, By the Act approved July 4, 1864, entitled &#8216;An
Act further to regulate and provide for the enrolling and calling
out the National Forces, and for other purposes,&#8217; it is provided
that the President of the United States may, at his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">472</a></span>
discretion, at any time hereafter, call for any number of men
as volunteers, for the respective terms of one, two, or three
years, for military service, and &#8216;that in case the quota, or any
part thereof, of any town, township, ward of a city, precinct,
or election district, or of a county not so subdivided, shall not
be filled within the space of fifty days after such call, then the
President shall immediately order a draft for one year to fill
such quota, or any part thereof, which may be unfilled.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">And whereas</span>, The new enrollment heretofore ordered is
so far completed as that the aforementioned Act of Congress
may now be put in operation for recruiting and keeping up
the strength of the armies in the field, for garrisons, and such
military operations as may be required for the purpose of
suppressing the rebellion and restoring the authority of the
United States Government in the insurgent States.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the
United States, do issue this, my call, for five hundred thousand
volunteers for the military service; provided, nevertheless,
that all credits which may be established under Section
Eight of the aforesaid Act, on account of persons who have
entered the naval service during the present Rebellion, and
by credits for men furnished to the military service in excess
of calls heretofore made for volunteers, will be accepted under
this call for one, two, or three years, as they may elect, and
will be entitled to the bounty provided by the law for the
period of service for which they enlist.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I hereby proclaim, order, and direct, that immediately
after the fifth day of September, 1864, being fifty days
from the date of this call, a draft for troops to serve for one
year, shall be held in every town, township, ward of a city,
precinct, election district, or a county not so subdivided, to
fill the quota which shall be assigned to it under this call, or
any part thereof which may be unfilled by volunteers on the
said fifth day of September, 1864.</p>

<p>&#8220;In testimony whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">473</a></span>
caused the seal of the United States to be affixed. Done at
the city of Washington, this eighteenth day of July, in the
year of our Lord, one thousand eight hundred and sixty-four,
and of the independence of the United States the eighty-ninth.</p>

<h3>LETTER TO MRS. GURNEY.</h3>

<p>This letter was written by the President prior to his re-election
to Mrs. Eliza P. Gurney, an American lady, the
widow of the late well-known Friend and philanthropist,
Joseph John Gurney, one of the wealthiest bankers of
London.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">My Esteemed Friend</span>: I have not forgotten, probably
never shall forget, the very impressive occasion when yourself
and friends visited me on a Sabbath forenoon two years
ago. Nor had your kind letter, written nearly a year later,
ever been forgotten. In all it has been your purpose to
strengthen my reliance in God. I am much indebted to the
good Christian people of the country for their constant prayers
and consolations, and to no one of them more than to yourself.
The purposes of the Almighty are perfect and must
prevail, though we erring mortals may fail to accurately perceive
them in advance. We hoped for a happy termination
of this terrible war, long before this, but God knows best,
and has ruled otherwise. We shall yet acknowledge His
wisdom and our own errors therein; meanwhile we must
work earnestly in the best lights He gives us, trusting that
so working still conduces to the great ends He ordains.
Surely, He intends some great good to follow this mighty
convulsion which no mortal could make, and no mortal
could stay.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">474</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;Your people&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;the Friends&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;have had, and are having
very great trials, on principles and faith opposed to both war
and oppression. They can only practically oppose oppression
by war. In this hard dilemma, some have chosen one horn
and some the other.</p>

<p>&#8220;For those appealing to me on conscientious grounds I have
done and shall do the best I could, and can, in my own conscience
under my oath to the law. That you believe this, I
doubt not, and believing it, I shall still receive for our country
and myself your earnest prayers to our father in Heaven.</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="l2">&#8220;Your sincere friend,</span><br />
&#8220;<span class="smcap">A. Lincoln.</span>&#8221;<br />

<h3>THE TENNESSEE TEST OATH.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p class="sigright">

<span class="l2">&#8220;<i>Executive Mansion</i>, Washington, D.&nbsp;C.,</span><br />
Saturday, October 22, 1864<br />
</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang">&#8220;MESSRS. WM.&nbsp;B. CAMPBELL, THOMAS A.&nbsp;R. NELSON, JAMES T.&nbsp;P.
CARTER, JOHN WILLIAMS, A. BLIZZARD, HENRY COOPER, BAILIE
PEYTON, JOHN LILLYETT, EMERSON ETHERIDGE, AND JOHN D.
PERRYMAN.</p></blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>: On the fifteenth day of this month, as I
remember, a printed paper manuscript, with a few manuscript
interlineations, called a protest, with your names appended
thereto, and accompanied by another printed paper, purporting
to be a proclamation by <span class="smcap">Andrew Johnson</span>, Military
Governor of Tennessee, and also a manuscript paper purporting
to be extracts from the code of Tennessee, were laid
before me.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>[The protest is here recited, and also the proclamation of
<span class="smcap">Gov. Johnson</span>, dated September 30, to which it refers, together
with a list of the counties in East, Middle, and West
Tennessee; also extracts from the code of Tennessee in relation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">475</a></span>
to electors of President and Vice President, qualifications
of voters for members of the General Assembly, and places
of holding elections and officers of popular elections.]</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;At the time these papers were presented as before stated,
I had never seen either of them, nor heard of the subject to
which they relate, except in a general way, only one day previously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Up to the present moment, nothing whatever upon the
subject has passed between <span class="smcap">Gov. Johnson</span>, or any one else
connected with the proclamation and myself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Since receiving the papers, as stated, I have given the
subject such brief consideration as I have been able to do, in
the midst of so many pressing duties.</p>

<p>&#8220;My conclusion is, that I can have nothing to do with the
matter, either to sustain the plan as the Convention and <span class="smcap">Gov.
Johnson</span> have initiated it, or to modify it as you demand.
By the Constitution and laws the President is charged with
no duty in the Presidential election in any State. Nor do I,
in this case, perceive any military reason for his interference
in the matter.</p>

<p>&#8220;The movement set a-foot by the Convention and <span class="smcap">Gov.
Johnson</span> does not, as seems to be assumed by you, emanate
from the National Executive.</p>

<p>&#8220;In no proper sense can it be considered other than as an
independent movement of at least a portion of the loyal people
of Tennessee.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not perceive in the plan any menace, or violence, or
coercion toward any one.</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Gov. Johnson</span>, like any other loyal citizen of Tennessee
has the right to form any political plan he chooses, and as
Military Governor it is his duty to keep the peace among
and for the loyal people of the State.</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot discern that by his plan he purposes any more&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;but
you object to the plan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">476</a></span>
&#8220;Leaving it alone will be your perfect security against it.
It is not proposed to force you into it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do as you please on your own account peaceably and
loyally, and <span class="smcap">Gov. Johnson</span> will not molest you, but will protect
you against violence so far as in his power.</p>

<p>&#8220;I presume that the conducting of a Presidential election
in Tennessee, in strict accordance with the old code of the
State, is not now a possibility.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is scarcely necessary to add, that if any election shall
be had, and any votes shall be cast in the State of Tennessee
for President and Vice-President of the United States, it will
belong not to the military agents nor yet to the Executive
Department, but exclusively to another department of the
Government, to determine whether they are entitled to be
counted in conformity with the Constitution and laws of the
United States.</p>

<p>&#8220;Except it be to give protection against violence, I decline
to interfere in any way with any Presidential election.</p>
